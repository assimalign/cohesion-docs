# Assimalign.Cohesion.ConfigurationStore.Client design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.ConfigurationStore.Client`.

> **Status:** Partial.

## Design intent

The client is the narrow gateway-side protocol boundary for ConfigurationStore. It reads named
configuration namespaces and submits control-plane commands without exposing or depending on the
store's hosting implementation. This keeps a gateway from acquiring a transitive dependency on
`Assimalign.Cohesion.ConfigurationStore.Hosting`.

## Dependency boundary

The package references only `Assimalign.Cohesion.Core`, solely for the Cohesion endpoint guard on
`System.Uri`. The guard requires an absolute, host-bearing URI with a port from 1 through 65535 and
rejects user information, query strings, and fragments. HTTP transport, authentication headers, and
JSON processing use BCL APIs. The package deliberately does not depend on the ConfigurationStore
area root, Hosting, DependencyInjection, Web, or ApplicationModel.

`ResourceCommand` and `ClientCredential` are package-local contracts. Their shapes match the store
protocol while avoiding a dependency on a runtime assembly merely to send a request.

## Public surface

`IConfigurationStoreClient` is the consumer contract. It lists namespace names, reads a named
namespace, and submits commands. `ConfigurationStoreClient.Create` validates that its endpoint uses
HTTP or HTTPS and returns an internal implementation. Client creation performs no network I/O.

The caller supplies an opaque `ClientCredential`. The client does not inspect JWT claims, load
token files, refresh credentials, or expose the token through formatting. It attaches the value as a
Bearer credential for every request.

## Wire protocol

The first protocol version has three operations:

| Operation | Request | Successful response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| List namespaces | `GET /cohesion/v1/namespaces` | A direct JSON array of namespace-name strings |
| `Read` namespace | `GET /cohesion/v1/namespaces?name=<escaped-name>` | A direct JSON object with string or `null` values |
| Submit command | `POST /cohesion/v1/commands` | Any success status with no required response body |

The endpoint's existing base path is prepended to every route. Namespace lookup names are
query-escaped and otherwise treated as opaque values. Listing preserves the server's array order and
duplicates. Command bodies use camel-case JSON and include the id, kind, owner, key, and
base64-encoded payload properties.

## Transport and ownership

The two-argument factories share a process-lifetime `HttpMessageInvoker` backed by
`SocketsHttpHandler`, with redirects and cookies disabled. Creating clients is synchronous and
performs no I/O. Both `Create` and
`CreateForControlPlane(Uri controlPlaneAddress, ClientCredential credential, HttpMessageInvoker transport)`
accept a caller-owned transport, including its TLS trust policy. The latter preserves the exact
manifest control-plane path for command delivery. The client never owns or disposes the supplied
transport; the caller retains it until requests finish, then disposes it. Trust discovery and
protected-file reading stay outside this Core-only package.

## Errors and cancellation

Blank namespace names and invalid endpoint schemes fail before transport use. HTTP failures retain
the BCL `HttpRequestException` shape through `EnsureSuccessStatusCode`. Invalid, empty, or JSON
`null` namespace-list and namespace-value documents fail with `JsonException`. Cancellation tokens
flow unchanged through send and content-read operations.

## AOT posture

All command serialization, namespace-list deserialization, and namespace-value deserialization use
`ConfigurationStoreClientJsonContext`, an internal `JsonSerializerContext`. No reflection-based
serializer overload, runtime assembly scan, or dynamic code generation is used. The project inherits
the repository's `net10.0`, trimming, and NativeAOT settings.

## Non-goals

- **Hosting or implementing ConfigurationStore** — endpoints.
- **Discovering endpoints or credentials** — from process state.
- **Parsing, validating, or refreshing** — the opaque Bearer credential.
- **Following redirects or retrying** — failed requests.
- **Providing dependency-injection registration or** — shared-framework delivery.

## Declarative command delivery

`ObserveCommandAsync` and `DeleteCommandAsync` return `ResourceCommandObservation` (Status and Detail),
including structured provider refusals from non-success HTTP statuses. Existing `SendCommandAsync`
retains its Task and EnsureSuccessStatusCode behavior. `CreateForControlPlane` accepts the full
manifest control-plane URI and makes those observation methods append only /commands, including
custom paths. The ordinary `Create` factory continues appending the existing /cohesion/v1 routes to
its resource endpoint base path. JSON parsing is explicit and transport cancellation remains
caller-controlled.

The existing custom-transport `Create` overload is public for gateway-supplied TLS trust. The caller
owns the HttpMessageInvoker and must retain it until requests complete, then dispose it. The client
remains Core-only and does not discover trust or read protected files.
