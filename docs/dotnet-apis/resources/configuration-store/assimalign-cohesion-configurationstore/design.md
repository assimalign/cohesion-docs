# Assimalign.Cohesion.ConfigurationStore design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.ConfigurationStore`.

> **Status:** Implemented.

## Design intent

The area root owns only the contracts that executable composition and feature packages target.
`IConfigurationStoreApplicationBuilder` declares first-start namespaces;
`IConfigurationStoreApplication` supplies the executable lifecycle.

## Hosting isolation

The root contracts are hosting-free (O34): `IConfigurationStoreApplication` exposes `Context`,
`StartAsync`, and `StopAsync`; `IConfigurationStoreApplicationContext` exposes `ContentRootPath`.
`IConfigurationStoreApplicationBuilder` owns area declarations and `Build()`. The root and feature
packages reference no `Assimalign.Cohesion.Hosting*` library; `COHRES004` enforces the boundary.

The concrete application, builder, and context live in
`Assimalign.Cohesion.ConfigurationStore.Hosting`; options and supporting services remain internal.

## Code-first namespaces

`AddNamespace(name, configure)` uses `IConfigurationNamespaceBuilder.Set` to capture string or null
values. These are declarative seeds, not an in-memory source of truth: Hosting writes them only when
the corresponding namespace has no durable document. The concrete Hosting builder supports explicit
`IHostService` instances and factories; their services start before the protocol listener and stop
after it.

## AOT posture

The contracts require no reflection, dynamic code generation, runtime assembly scanning, or
container-based activation and remain safe for trimming and NativeAOT.

## Hosting-free application contract (O34)

`ConfigurationStoreApplication.CreateBuilder(args)` returns the public concrete
`ConfigurationStoreApplicationBuilder`; its `Build()` returns the public
`ConfigurationStoreApplication : Host<ConfigurationStoreApplicationContext>`. The public
`ConfigurationStoreApplicationContext` implements `IConfigurationStoreApplicationContext`, reading
`ContentRootPath` from the host environment. The application explicitly forwards the root lifecycle
contract to `IHost`, and consumers use the concrete application for `RunAsync` and `await using`.
Runtime options and supporting services remain internal.

Background-work registration (`AddService`) is available only on the concrete Hosting builder.
