# Assimalign.Cohesion.ConfigurationStore.ApplicationModel design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.ConfigurationStore.ApplicationModel`.

> **Status:** Partial.

## Intent

This project is the ConfigurationStore area's AOT-compatible, dependency-guarded orchestration
package. It gives a gateway a typed configuration-store resource, a platform-neutral realization
planner, and the default control-plane factory that every orchestration-enabled configuration-store
executable registers. It never references `ConfigurationStore.Hosting`, a gateway implementation,
or a platform object model.

An enabled `Sdk.ConfigurationStore` executable produces `cohesion/resource/v1` at build time.
Generated gateway code passes that `ResourceManifest` to `AddConfigurationStore(...)`; this package
does not reconstruct endpoint, mount, artifact, or lifecycle facts from conventions.

## Manifest-backed resource

`ConfigurationStoreResource` derives from `PlannedResource`. The base snapshots the supplied
`ResourceManifest` and projects its executable, endpoint, and mount compatibility surfaces. The
manifest remains the source of truth for:

- **executable or image** — identity;
- **the `api` endpoint and** — its probes;
- **the persistent `data` mount** — and declared size;
- **lifecycle limits, application identity,** — settings, and references; and
- **the default control-plane** — location.

`ConfigurationStoreResourceOptions` derives from the shared `ResourceOptions` and exposes
deployer-owned planning overrides. `Storage.Size` overrides the `data` claim's `mounts[].size`
value. The shared `Replicas` property is present, but this planner rejects values other than one
until a replication protocol exists. Ports, mount paths, endpoint exposure, and arbitrary
environment values remain executable-owned manifest facts.

## ConfigurationStore planner

`ConfigurationStoreResource.CreatePlan(PlanContext)` is reported as `ConfigurationStore planner` in
application-build diagnostics. Before generic trait mapping, the planner requires:

- **manifest kind `ConfigurationStore`, compared** — ordinally;
- **a `StatefulSet`** — workload;
- **exactly one endpoint, named** — `api`; and
- **exactly one `Volume` mount,** — named `data`; Secret and Configuration mounts (such as the `tls` certificate mount the SDK declares for the https endpoint) may sit beside it and never produce a claim.

The shared generic planner then produces `cohesion/plan/v1`. The area planner verifies the
resulting stateful shape: exactly one replica with stable workload identity, exactly one sized
per-replica `data` claim, one ordinary API service, and exactly one portless, headless governing
service. A checked-in golden plan pins that complete compiler-facing IR shape.

The result contains only Cohesion realization-plan records. Kubernetes StatefulSets, claims and
services, Docker volumes, and local directories are produced later by the selected platform
compiler.

## Composition API

`AddConfigurationStore(manifest, options)` creates a `ConfigurationStoreResource`, applies the
typed storage override, and adds it to the application graph. Planning remains deferred until
`IApplicationBuilder.Build()` so the planner receives the selected environment and the final
referenced-manifest map.

See the [source-backed usage examples](examples/index.md).

Generated gateway verbs supply the manifest and expose the same optional typed options; application
authors normally do not load the JSON themselves.

## Default control plane

`ConfigurationStoreResourceControlPlane.Create()` returns a fresh
`Hosting.Resources.IResourceControlPlane`. The enabled resource's generated
`ResourceControlPlane.g.cs` registers that factory with `ResourceRuntime` and seeds it with the
invocation's observed endpoints. `ConfigurationStore.Hosting` reads the registration through the
shared seam and serves it on the manifest's `api` endpoint; neither package references the other.

The hosting terminal provides `GET` /`HEAD` health, readiness, liveness, endpoint, and
command-discovery routes under `/cohesion/v1`, plus `POST /cohesion/v1/stop` and
`POST /cohesion/v1/commands`. The short `/healthz`, `/readyz`, and `/livez` probe paths are also
available. Namespaced routes use the ambient bootstrap Bearer credential when one is present and
fail closed for managed contexts without a credential.

The accepted command-kind set contains `configurationstore.add-namespace`,
`configurationstore.set-value`, and `configurationstore.remove-value`, whose wire handlers live in
Hosting. Typed `AddNamespace`, `SetValue`, and `RemoveValue` descriptor verbs declare these kinds.
`AddNamespace` supplies the separate namespace-ownership contract described below.

## Dependency and AOT posture

`COHAM001` constrains the complete production dependency closure to `Assimalign.Cohesion.Core`,
`Assimalign.Cohesion.ApplicationModel`, `Assimalign.Cohesion.Hosting`,
`Assimalign.Cohesion.Hosting.Health`, `Assimalign.Cohesion.Hosting.Resources`, and the permitted
BCL surface. The planner uses typed records and ordinary loops only. Golden serialization uses
`ResourcePlanJsonContext`; there is no reflection, runtime code generation, ConfigurationStore
runtime dependency, or platform SDK dependency.

## Non-goals

- **Hosting the API, health** — endpoints, storage engine, or configuration protocol.
- **Inventing a manifest from** — a resource name or executable-name convention.
- **Carrying platform-specific scheduling, storage-class,** — service, or claim types.
- **Client factories or remote** — protocol calls; those belong to
  `ConfigurationStore.Client`.
- **Adopting a resource-declared namespace** — through a command without an explicit ownership transfer.

## Typed descriptor commands

`AddConfigurationStore` returns `IConfigurationStoreResourceDescriptor`.
`RemoteReferenceConfigurationStore(declaration, configure)` binds a manifest-backed external with
the same surface. The internal wrapper retains the registered graph resource identity.

`SetValue(namespaceName, key, JsonElement|string value, optional: false)` records
`configurationstore.set-value` with `{ "namespace", "key", "value" }`; values must be strings or
null, matching the landed store contract. `RemoveValue(namespaceName, key, optional: false)` records
`configurationstore.remove-value` with `{ "namespace", "key" }`. Both use `namespace/key` as the
ownership conflict key and source-generated payload metadata; JSON properties are canonicalized by
ApplicationModel. Value keys cannot contain `/`; namespace names may, so different values cannot
alias the same ownership key. A model may declare one set or remove command per target/key. These
declarations carry ordinary configuration, never secrets, because model export retains them.
`Build()` checks the manifest's accepted kinds; delivery and mutation remain gateway/Hosting work.

## Declarative commands (item 31c)

| Wire kind | Descriptor verb | Ownership key |
|---|---|---|
| `configurationstore.add-namespace` | `AddNamespace` | namespace name |

Kinds use verb-noun kebab under the area prefix. The examples `rezolvr.record` and
`identityhub.audience` in developer-experience design section 7 are illustrative; item 27's design
rewrite should reflect the landed convention. Manifest commands remain bare JSON strings. Typed
verbs validate argument shape and use source-generated JSON metadata. `Build` validates the advertised
kind, canonical payload, deterministic id, and uniqueness of the target ownership key. The default
control plane handles id replay and owner isolation; each area handler also accepts an identical
reapplication with a different id. Conflicts return named Rejected details.

`AddNamespace` creates a namespace if absent and atomically stores its owner and original seed
alongside values. An identical declaration succeeds even after separate value commands change its
contents. A different seed or foreign owner is rejected with a named detail. Resource-seeded
namespaces are not implicitly adopted. Deletion removes the owned namespace; callers should remove
its value commands first. Existing `SetValue` and `RemoveValue` behavior remains unchanged, including
404 for unknown namespaces.
