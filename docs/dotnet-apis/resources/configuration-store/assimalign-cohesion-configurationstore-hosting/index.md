# Assimalign.Cohesion.ConfigurationStore.Hosting

Provides the public `ConfigurationStoreApplication.CreateBuilder(args)` entry point and the public concrete durable ConfigurationStore host, builder, and context.

> **Status:** Partial.

## Summary

Provides the public `ConfigurationStoreApplication.CreateBuilder(args)` entry point and the public
concrete durable ConfigurationStore host, builder, and context.

## Current Evaluation

- **Status** — code-first namespaces, durable JSON storage, authenticated HTTP protocol, default control plane
- **Runtime boundary** — ConfigurationStore root plus shared Hosting/Resources/Health, private Web transport, and IdentityModel JWT verification

## Primary Responsibilities

- **`Capture`** — `AddNamespace` declarations as first-start seeds.
- **Persist configuration as plain** — JSON beneath the `data` volume using atomic replacement.
- **Serve list/read/set/remove operations plus** — standard health, endpoints, and stop routes.
- **`Verify`** — gateway bootstrap JWTs against the durable trusted-issuer set.
- **Preserve plain-application behavior when** — resource opt-in is disabled.

The protocol listener starts after user services and drains before them. Enabled resources bind the
ambient `api` endpoint; plain applications use `--endpoint` or the loopback default.

## Public types

- **`ConfigurationStoreApplication`** — concrete host and creation entry point.
- **`ConfigurationStoreApplicationBuilder`** — composition and background-work registration.
- **`ConfigurationStoreApplicationContext`** — host environment and runtime state.

## Declarative commands

Configuration commands now register runtime handlers on the same IResourceControlPlane used by
direct in-process delivery. The HTTP adapter authenticates first, preserving issuer/owner equality
(403), missing namespaces (404), and unsupported kinds (501), with status/detail JSON on command
refusals. Other ownership refusals return 409. POST continues to accept the existing envelope and
set payload {value}; typed declarations can additionally include namespace/key, which must match the
envelope key. Configuration keys cannot contain `/`; namespaces may contain it, preserving one
ownership identity. DELETE commands uses the same envelope: removing a set declaration removes its
value; removing a remove-value declaration releases ownership without restoring an undeclared
historical value.

## Commands

| Wire kind | Descriptor verb | Ownership key |
|---|---|---|
| `configurationstore.add-namespace` | `AddNamespace` | namespace name |

`AddNamespace` creates a namespace if absent and atomically stores its owner and original seed
alongside values. An identical declaration succeeds even after separate value commands change its
contents. A different seed or foreign owner is rejected with a named detail. Resource-seeded
namespaces are not implicitly adopted. Deletion removes the owned namespace; callers should remove
its value commands first. Existing `SetValue` and `RemoveValue` behavior remains unchanged, including
404 for unknown namespaces.

## Concrete composition (T10 / O34)

`ConfigurationStoreApplication.CreateBuilder(args)` returns the public concrete
`ConfigurationStoreApplicationBuilder`; its `Build()` returns the public
`ConfigurationStoreApplication : Host<ConfigurationStoreApplicationContext>`. The public
`ConfigurationStoreApplicationContext` implements `IConfigurationStoreApplicationContext`, reading
`ContentRootPath` from the host environment. The application explicitly forwards the root lifecycle
contract to `IHost`, and consumers use the concrete application for `RunAsync` and `await using`.
Runtime options and supporting services remain internal.

Background-work registration belongs to the concrete `ConfigurationStoreApplicationBuilder`:
`AddService(IHostService)` and
`AddService(Func<ConfigurationStoreApplicationContext, IHostService>)`. The factory receives the
same concrete context as Web's and `Database`'s `AddService`, so hosting consumers can use environment,
state, and hosted-service members beyond the small root contract. Factories run once per build
against the same context retained by the application; the hosted-service snapshot is installed after
factory evaluation. Services start in registration order and stop in reverse. No area-owned service
abstraction is introduced.

The base host owns the already-cancelled run semantic: one complete start and graceful stop with
fresh lifecycle tokens, normal run-observer notifications, and a final Stopped state. The concrete
application and IHost route share it. Startup failures still roll back and propagate.
