# Assimalign.Cohesion.LogSpace.ApplicationModel design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.LogSpace.ApplicationModel`.

> **Status:** Partial.

`LogSpaceResource` wraps a manifest snapshot and typed `LogSpaceResourceOptions`, and delegates to its
internal planner. `AddLogSpace` returns `ILogSpaceResourceDescriptor`, a thin graph-descriptor wrapper
retaining dependencies and the built plan. The planner validates the kind, StatefulSet workload,
declared area endpoint schemes/protocols, and query control plane at /cohesion/v1, then delegates
realization to GenericPlanner. Endpoint ports, extra endpoints, secret/configuration mounts, and
generic deployer options remain manifest-driven; no platform types are referenced.

The planner requires otlp https/tcp (SDK port 4318), alongside query https/tcp:8443, StatefulSet,
and the data Volume at /data with 10Gi. The planner requires the sized data mount; deployer
`Storage.Size` may override capacity. The control plane does not implement telemetry ingestion (item
31b).

`LogSpaceResourceControlPlane.Create` returns a fresh Hosting.Resources control plane with no accepted
command kinds. Runtime Hosting discovers the generated registration and serves its protocol through
the private Web.Hosting.Resources feature. Unsupported command envelopes are refused with 501;
domain commands are deferred to item 31c.

The package is NuGet-only (developer-experience design D4/O2), never a framework member. Its only
direct dependencies are ApplicationModel and Hosting.Resources; `COHAM001` checks its full resolved
closure. Public resource/options values follow PlannedResource and ResourceOptions; the descriptor
is interface-first and its implementation is internal. No runtime hosting, DI, reflection
serialization, or gateway implementation enters this package.
