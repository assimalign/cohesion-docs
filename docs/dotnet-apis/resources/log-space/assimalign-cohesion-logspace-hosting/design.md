# Assimalign.Cohesion.LogSpace.Hosting design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.LogSpace.Hosting`.

> **Status:** Partial.

## Platform sink and boundaries

Item 31b makes LogSpace the Platform sink for Hosting.Telemetry. The resource root remains
contract-only; all composition is in Hosting. OTLP/HTTP JSON logs are accepted, protobuf receives
415 with an OTLP/JSON-only detail. /v1/traces and /v1/metrics are reserved POST routes returning 501
after authentication/content validation: libraries/Logging has no span or instrument primitive, and
protobuf is deferred. No gRPC framing or response-trailer support exists in the HTTP server;
therefore the SDK otlp endpoint changed from grpc/tcp 4317 to https/tcp 4318, Certificate=tls. query
stays https/tcp 8443. Both Public flags remain false: application reachability through observed
endpoints is not external exposure.

## HTTP and TLS

`Local` is the developer-machine environment. `Development` is a deployable environment and requires
a mounted certificate even on loopback, as does `Production`. An unset environment still resolves
to `Production`.

OtlpReceiverEndpointService mirrors LogSpaceControlPlaneEndpointService: parameterless
`WebApplication.CreateBuilder` avoids recursive ambient registration,
TryGetEndpointCertificate(endpoint, out leaf, out chain) builds the TLS certificate context, and
only loopback Local permits CreateDevelopmentEndpointCertificate fallback. Both listeners fail
closed otherwise. One tls Secret mount may back both listeners. Outbound exporters use
CreateOutboundTrustValidator and the application trust bundle; there is no blanket certificate
bypass.

Middleware checks known path, method, authentication and application/json content. Wrong method
yields 405/Allow: POST, unknown path 404, malformed JSON 400, missing credential 401/Bearer
challenge, wrong audience or scope 403, oversized body 413 and unavailable storage 503.
Http.RequestLimits is a private reference. LogSpace owns the one-MiB Content-Length check and
bounded streaming read, returning 413 with Connection: close. The listener body cap is disabled
because its post-dispatch Http1LimitExceededException currently closes the connection without a 413;
header and data-rate transport limits remain in force. No HTTP-area code was changed. JSON uses a
depth bound and at most 8192 records per request. Full acceptance returns {"partialSuccess":{}};
queue overflow returns rejectedLogRecords as an int64 string. Traces/metrics have no acceptance
path.

## Authentication and middleware order

The private ES256 verifier is modelled on Web.Hosting.Resources.BootstrapTokenVerifier:
issuer=application, key ID/algorithm/signature, required iss/sub/aud/exp/nbf/iat/jti, at most
24-hour lifetime, audience=LogSpace resource name. Ingest additionally requires scope=telemetry and
a nonblank subject identifying the emitter; service.name must equal that subject. The gateway uses a
distinct (application,sink,emitter) token cache; tokens are not the sink's bootstrap credential.

The query middleware is registered BEFORE `UseResourceControlPlane` in
LogSpaceControlPlaneEndpointService. `ResourceControlPlaneMiddleware.InvokeAsync` authenticates
unknown /cohesion/v1/* paths then returns 404
(Web.Hosting.Resources/src/Internal/`ResourceControlPlaneMiddleware`.cs:44-59,185-191); it would
swallow a later query handler. The earlier LogSpace middleware rejects telemetry-scoped credentials
on every namespaced query/management request before forwarding other routes, protecting /stop and
/commands despite the unchanged shared verifier. Query accepts only own-name audience with gateway
subject and ordinary bootstrap/dev tokens. No cohesion-export audience was added.

## `Storage`, lifecycle and query

ResourceContext.GetMount("data", `ContentRootPath`/logs) selects the filesystem store. Receiver
threads enqueue immutable records to a channel bounded to 8192 entries and a conservative 64 MiB
estimated record budget. SegmentFlushService owns synchronous writes and fsync on its dedicated
thread, every 250 ms and on stop; receivers stop before the flush service. Files are append-only
logs-YYYYMMDD-NNNN.ndjson, rotated daily or at 16 MiB; each restart opens a fresh lexically ordered
segment. Records have t (nanosecond string), sev, sevText, svc, cat, body and attrs. A per-segment
.index records first/last timestamps and count; the minimal query currently scans segments instead
of relying on this sidecar. IOException/UnauthorizedAccess marks the store unavailable, retaining
queued entries for a subsequent flush and yielding 503 rather than stopping the host. Retention and
crash-tail repair remain future work.

Queries filter service.name and timestamp, cap limit to 1000, and return bounded NDJSON. Base64
cursors carry segment/line position and a filter fingerprint, with path validation; they grant no
authorization. A cursor on the final full page may yield an empty next page. Producer-controlled
JSON uses manual JsonDocument validation; stored records and cursors use source-generated
LogSpaceJsonContext, without reflection serialization.

R-5 explicitly defers the developer-experience design §8 `Database.Embedded` storage requirement to
the `Database` MVP embedded-consumption phase; this segment implementation is not a replacement
architectural decision. No cross-area `Database` reference was added.

## Telemetry ordering

The gateway injects only after a same-application LogSpace is Running with an observed otlp
endpoint; no self-export is injected. A producer prepared earlier gets no telemetry; a later
preparation can receive it, while an already-running process needs restart to read changed
environment. No implicit `DependsOn` was added. Explicit producer.`DependsOn`(sink) establishes
deterministic startup. RemoteReference injection awaits an authenticated named-OTLP resolution
contract.

## Non-goals

LogSpace.Telemetry remains empty project scaffolding, distinct from Hosting.Telemetry. Verifier
consolidation, inferred telemetry dependencies, retention/archival, protobuf, gRPC, traces and
metrics are separate deliverables.

## Concrete composition (T10 / O34)

`LogSpaceApplication.CreateBuilder(args)` returns the public concrete `LogSpaceApplicationBuilder`;
its `Build()` returns the public `LogSpaceApplication : Host<LogSpaceApplicationContext>`. The
public `LogSpaceApplicationContext` implements `ILogSpaceApplicationContext`, reading
`ContentRootPath` from the host environment. The application explicitly forwards the root lifecycle
contract to `IHost`, and consumers use the concrete application for `RunAsync` and `await using`.
Runtime options and supporting services remain internal.

Background-work registration belongs to the concrete `LogSpaceApplicationBuilder`:
`AddService(IHostService)` and `AddService(Func<LogSpaceApplicationContext, IHostService>)`. The
factory receives the same concrete context as Web's and `Database`'s `AddService`, so hosting consumers
can use environment, state, and hosted-service members beyond the small root contract. Factories run
once per build against the same context retained by the application; the hosted-service snapshot is
installed after factory evaluation. Services start in registration order and stop in reverse. No
area-owned service abstraction is introduced.
