`LogSpaceApplication.CreateBuilder`(args).`Build`() composes the ambient resource. An enabled otlp
endpoint registers the receiver and a dedicated segment flush service. query hosts management and
GET /cohesion/v1/logs; a plain unregistered host remains an ordered collection of explicit services.
SinkHost demonstrates the ambient contract.

POST /v1/logs requires application/json and a signed ES256 telemetry token. Query accepts resource,
since (ISO-8601), limit (default 100/max 1000), and cursor, returning application/x-ndjson and
X-Cohesion-`Next`-Cursor when more scanning is possible. Query pages are bounded to four million
characters (plus at most one bounded record). Query and management require the sink's ordinary
bootstrap/dev credential; telemetry scope is rejected.

## Concrete composition (T10 / O34)

`LogSpaceApplication.CreateBuilder(args)` returns the public concrete `LogSpaceApplicationBuilder`;
its `Build()` returns the public `LogSpaceApplication : Host<LogSpaceApplicationContext>`. The
public `LogSpaceApplicationContext` implements `ILogSpaceApplicationContext`, reading
`ContentRootPath` from the host environment. The application explicitly forwards the root lifecycle
contract to `IHost`, and consumers use the concrete application for `RunAsync` and `await using`.
Runtime options and supporting services remain internal.

Background-work registration belongs to the concrete `LogSpaceApplicationBuilder`:
`AddService(IHostService)` and `AddService(Func<LogSpaceApplicationContext, IHostService>)`. The
factory receives the same concrete context as Web's and `Database`'s `AddService`, so hosting consumers
can use environment, state, and hosted-service members beyond the small root contract. Factories run
once per build against the same context retained by the application; the hosted-service snapshot is
installed after factory evaluation. Services start in registration order and stop in reverse. No
area-owned service abstraction is introduced.
