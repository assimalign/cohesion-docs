# Assimalign.Cohesion.IdentityHub design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.IdentityHub`.

> **Status:** Implemented.

## `Application` seam

The area root owns the public contracts composed by an IdentityHub resource.
`IIdentityHubApplicationBuilder` declares token audiences with `AddAudience`, registers OAuth
clients with `AddClient`, and builds `IIdentityHubApplication`. The public concrete application,
builder, and context live in `Assimalign.Cohesion.IdentityHub.Hosting`.

Client registration is intentionally code-first. A non-empty `ClientSecret` enables
`client_credentials`; `AllowDeviceAuthorization` enables the device grant. Clients explicitly list
the audiences they may request, and build fails if a client names an undeclared audience or enables
no grant. Corresponding declarative gateway commands now ship in IdentityHub.ApplicationModel;
Hosting combines their durable registry with these builder registrations.

## Security boundary

The public options carry a client secret only during composition. Hosting snapshots options and
retains only a SHA-256 digest, compared in fixed time. Access-token lifetimes are positive and
capped at 24 hours. IdentityHub builds protocol tokens on the shared IdentityModel and JWT contracts
instead of defining competing token, claim, subject, credential, or session primitives.

## Hosting isolation and AOT

The root references Core and IdentityModel contracts, with no Hosting library reference. HTTP
serving, persistence, cryptography, and ResourceRuntime integration belong to the Hosting module.
The surface requires no runtime scanning, dynamic code generation, or container activation and
remains trimming- and NativeAOT-safe.

## Hosting-free application contract (O34)

The root contracts are hosting-free (O34): `IIdentityHubApplication` exposes `Context`,
`StartAsync`, and `StopAsync`; `IIdentityHubApplicationContext` exposes `ContentRootPath`.
`IIdentityHubApplicationBuilder` owns area declarations and `Build()`. The root and feature
packages reference no `Assimalign.Cohesion.Hosting*` library; `COHRES004` enforces the boundary.

`IdentityHubApplication.CreateBuilder(args)` returns the public concrete
`IdentityHubApplicationBuilder`; its `Build()` returns the public
`IdentityHubApplication : Host<IdentityHubApplicationContext>`. The public
`IdentityHubApplicationContext` implements `IIdentityHubApplicationContext`, reading
`ContentRootPath` from the host environment. The application explicitly forwards the root lifecycle
contract to `IHost`, and consumers use the concrete application for `RunAsync` and `await using`.
Runtime options and supporting services remain internal.

Background-work registration (`AddService`) is available only on the concrete Hosting builder.
