# Assimalign.Cohesion.IdentityHub.ApplicationModel

This package supplies the manifest-backed `IdentityHubResource`, typed `IdentityHubResourceOptions`, `AddIdentityHub(...)`, the IdentityHub planner, and the default `IdentityHubResourceControlPlane` factory.

This package supplies the manifest-backed `IdentityHubResource`, typed `IdentityHubResourceOptions`
, `AddIdentityHub(...)`, the IdentityHub planner, and the default `IdentityHubResourceControlPlane`
factory.

The planner requires a singleton `StatefulSet`, an HTTPS-over-TCP endpoint named `https`, and
exactly one persistent, sized `data` Volume. The SDK defaults that endpoint to private HTTPS and
supplies readiness and liveness probes. Additional endpoints and non-persistent Configuration or
Secret mounts pass through unchanged, including a gateway-resolved `tls` mount. The planner emits
only `cohesion/plan/v1` records; platform compilers realize the workload later.

## Dependencies

- **Detail** — `Assimalign.Cohesion.Hosting.Resources`

`COHAM001` guards the full production dependency closure. The package never references
IdentityHub.Hosting, a gateway assembly, or a platform SDK.

The runtime `AddAudience` and `AddClient` verbs ship in the area root. The default control plane
advertises identityhub.add-audience and identityhub.add-client for the typed descriptor command
counterparts.

## Commands

| Wire kind | Descriptor verb | Ownership key |
|---|---|---|
| `identityhub.add-audience` | `AddAudience` | audience name |
| `identityhub.add-client` | `AddClient` | client id |

The typed `IIdentityHubResourceDescriptor` retains its command surface through `DependsOn` chaining.
Audience and client commands are registered on the default control plane and served by the existing
authenticated API endpoint, with POST/DELETE and JSON refusal observations. Owner must equal the
authenticated application issuer; transport and bootstrap-token verification are unchanged.

The command registry is written atomically to `registry.json` beside IdentitySigningKey under the
resource data path. Startup restores the registry and control-plane ownership before serving. `Token`
issuance reads the live combined registry of builder-declared and command-declared clients;
discovery and JWKS remain the same issuer surface. Audience removal is rejected while a client uses
it.

Client credentialSource names a resource Secret mount, optionally prefixed with `mount:`. The
declaration stores the mount name, never credential bytes. Hosting reads and hashes the mounted
credential when initializing or updating the registry, so restart requires the mount again. Clients
must reference existing audiences; add the audience before the client. Conflicting resource seeds or
changed client declarations are rejected until the owning declaration is deleted.
