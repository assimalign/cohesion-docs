# Assimalign.Cohesion.IdentityHub.ApplicationModel design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.IdentityHub.ApplicationModel`.

> **Status:** Partial.

## Intent

IdentityHub owns its platform-neutral orchestration decisions without owning platform objects. An
enabled `Sdk.IdentityHub` executable produces the generic resource manifest; this package validates
its area shape and turns it into `cohesion/plan/v1` at application build time.

## Planner contract

`IdentityHubResource` is a `PlannedResource` whose diagnostic name is `IdentityHub planner`. The
planner requires kind `IdentityHub`, a `StatefulSet`, an HTTPS-over-TCP endpoint named `https`,
and exactly one persistent `data` Volume. Generic planning must then produce one stable replica, a
sized per-replica claim, one HTTPS service, and one portless headless governing service. Additional
endpoints and non-persistent Configuration or Secret mounts remain legal generic traits. Scaling is
rejected until IdentityHub defines a replication protocol.

`IdentityHubResourceOptions.Storage.Size` may replace the manifest claim size. Endpoint ports,
paths, exposure, mounts, and lifecycle defaults remain manifest facts.

## Default control plane

`IdentityHubResourceControlPlane.Create()` returns a fresh `Hosting.Resources.IResourceControlPlane`
. Generated `ResourceControlPlane.g.cs` registers the factory for enabled executables, and
IdentityHub.Hosting serves it through the shared runtime seam without either package referencing the
other. Accepted command kinds are `identityhub.add-audience` and `identityhub.add-client`, declared
through the typed descriptor.

## AOT and dependency posture

`COHAM001` restricts the closure to Core, ApplicationModel, plain Hosting, Hosting.Health,
Hosting.Resources, ProtectedData, and BCL assemblies. Planning uses typed records and ordinary
loops; golden serialization uses `ResourcePlanJsonContext`. There is no runtime reflection, dynamic
generation, gateway dependency, or platform-specific model.

## Non-goals

- **Hosting IdentityHub endpoints or** — implementing identity protocols.
- **Defining token, claim, session,** — credential, or JWK models.
- **Adding gateway implementation dependencies** — to the guarded declaration package.
- **Carrying Kubernetes, Docker, or** — other platform objects.

## Declarative commands (item 31c)

| Wire kind | Descriptor verb | Ownership key |
|---|---|---|
| `identityhub.add-audience` | `AddAudience` | audience name |
| `identityhub.add-client` | `AddClient` | client id |

Kinds use verb-noun kebab under the area prefix. The examples `rezolvr.record` and
`identityhub.audience` in developer-experience design section 7 are illustrative; item 27's design
rewrite should reflect the landed convention. Manifest commands remain bare JSON strings. Typed
verbs validate argument shape and use source-generated JSON metadata. `Build` validates the advertised
kind, canonical payload, deterministic id, and uniqueness of the target ownership key. The default
control plane handles id replay and owner isolation; each area handler also accepts an identical
reapplication with a different id. Conflicts return named Rejected details.

The typed `IIdentityHubResourceDescriptor` retains its command surface through `DependsOn` chaining.
Audience and client commands are registered on the default control plane and served by the existing
authenticated API endpoint, with POST/DELETE and JSON refusal observations. Owner must equal the
authenticated application issuer; transport and bootstrap-token verification are unchanged.

The command registry is written atomically to `registry.json` beside IdentitySigningKey under the
resource data path. Startup restores the registry and control-plane ownership before serving. `Token`
issuance reads the live combined registry of builder-declared and command-declared clients;
discovery and JWKS remain the same issuer surface. Audience removal is rejected while a client uses
it.

Client credentialSource names a resource Secret mount, optionally prefixed with `mount:`. The
declaration stores the mount name, never credential bytes. Hosting reads and hashes the mounted
credential when initializing or updating the registry, so restart requires the mount again. Clients
must reference existing audiences; add the audience before the client. Conflicting resource seeds or
changed client declarations are rejected until the owning declaration is deleted.
