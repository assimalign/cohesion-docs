# IdentityHubCommandClient

The `IdentityHubCommandClient` type belongs to `Assimalign.Cohesion.IdentityHub.Client`.

> **Status:** Partial.

Static factory `Create(Uri controlPlaneAddress, string credential)` returns an
`IIdentityHubCommandClient`. The URI must be absolute HTTP(S), include the control-plane prefix,
and contain no user information, query or fragment. The credential must be nonblank. Invalid
arguments throw argument exceptions. `Dispose` the returned client when finished; creation performs no
network I/O.

`IdentityHubCommandClient.Create(Uri controlPlaneAddress, string bearerToken, HttpMessageInvoker transport)`
accepts a caller-owned transport, including its TLS trust policy. Disposing the returned client does
not dispose that transport; the caller retains it until requests finish and disposes it afterward.
The two-argument factory still creates a transport owned and disposed by the client. Both overloads
perform the same endpoint and credential validation; a null supplied transport throws
`ArgumentNullException`. The client does not discover application trust.
