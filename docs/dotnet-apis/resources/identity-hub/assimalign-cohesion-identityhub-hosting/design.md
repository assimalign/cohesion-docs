# Assimalign.Cohesion.IdentityHub.Hosting design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.IdentityHub.Hosting`.

> **Status:** Implemented.

## Issuer runtime

`Local` is the developer-machine environment. `Development` is a deployable environment and follows
the same transport and device-approval restrictions as `Production`; an unset environment still
resolves to `Production`.

Every built host registers one internal HTTP issuer after user services. The endpoint is resolved
from the generated control plane, the ambient `https` resource endpoint, `--endpoint`, then
`https://127.0.0.1:8443`. State is resolved from the `data` mount, `--data`, then the resource
content root. Plain HTTP is permitted only on loopback in Local.

The issuer exposes public OpenID Provider metadata, JWKS, and token endpoints. It accepts exactly
the implemented `openid` scope or an empty scope and returns `invalid_scope` for every other
client-controlled value. Client authentication accepts exactly one of HTTP Basic or form
credentials, constrains the requested `audience` /`resource` to the registration, and issues ES256
bearer JWTs. Confidential clients authenticate at device authorization and polling as well as for
client credentials.

Device authorization and the built-in verification page are available only when the issuer itself
binds to loopback in Local. High-entropy device codes, human-readable user codes, a ten-minute
lifetime, pending polling, one-shot consumption, and an ID token when `openid` was requested remain
supported there. The page has no client-selected subject: every local approval signs in the fixed
`development-user` identity, checks a supplied browser origin when present, and emits restrictive
cache, framing, referrer, and content-security headers. Discovery omits the device endpoint and
grant outside that Local mode. Production account login, consent, recovery, federation, and subject
selection require a separately authenticated user-flow implementation.

## Keys and tokens

The data mount contains one persisted P-256 PKCS#8 signing key. Creation uses an atomic
same-directory move and owner-only permissions on Unix. JWKS publishes only public `EC`
/`P-256`/`ES256` coordinates; `kid` is the RFC 7638 SHA-256 thumbprint of canonical public members.
`Token` creation uses IdentityModel's `JsonWebTokenWriter`. Signing is serialized because the ECDSA
instance is shared.

HTTPS consumes a materialized `tls` resource mount containing the PEM leaf certificate, matching
private key, and optional chain. This uses the existing `ResourceMount` carrier, including its
in-process bytes and Windows protected-file behavior. When that mount is absent, an ephemeral
self-signed certificate is allowed only on loopback in Local; every other HTTPS binding fails closed
with an explicit configuration error. TLS material is always distinct from the issuer signing key.
ResourceContext resolves generated endpoint-to-mount metadata, with `tls` as the compatibility
fallback. The shared reader preserves the same single PEM document and certificate chain.

Issued access tokens contain `iss`, `sub`, `aud`, `iat`, `nbf`, `exp`, `jti`, `client_id`,
and token-use metadata. The configured lifetime is capped at 24 hours.

## Resource control plane

The builder captures `ResourceRuntime.Current`, resolves a registered area control plane from the
executable assembly, and calls `ResourceRuntime.HostBuilt` exactly once. Public `/healthz`,
`/readyz`, and `/livez` routes coexist with `/cohesion/v1/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/livez`,
`/endpoints`, `/stop`, and `/commands`.

Every `/cohesion/v1/*` request is authenticated when a gateway is ambient. The verifier parses the
application trust JWK, verifies the ES256 signature explicitly, then validates issuer, gateway
subject, resource audience, required claims, temporal bounds, token ID, and a maximum 24-hour
lifetime. Missing or malformed credentials return 401 with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer`; a valid
token for another resource returns 403. The default control plane serves the declarative `AddAudience`
and `AddClient` command kinds.

## AOT and dependency boundary

Hosting privately composes Cohesion Web/HTTP/connection libraries and the shared IdentityModel JWT
implementation. Routes use direct dispatch and `Utf8JsonWriter`; there is no reflection-based
routing, serializer metadata discovery, or dynamic activation.

## Declarative commands (item 31c)

| Wire kind | Descriptor verb | Ownership key |
|---|---|---|
| `identityhub.add-audience` | `AddAudience` | audience name |
| `identityhub.add-client` | `AddClient` | client id |

Kinds use verb-noun kebab under the area prefix. The examples `rezolvr.record` and
`identityhub.audience` in developer-experience design section 7 are illustrative; item 27's design
rewrite should reflect the landed convention. Manifest commands remain bare JSON strings. Typed
verbs validate argument shape and use source-generated JSON metadata. `Build` validates the advertised
kind, canonical payload, deterministic id, and uniqueness of the target ownership key. The default
control plane handles id replay and owner isolation; each area handler also accepts an identical
reapplication with a different id. Conflicts return named Rejected details.

The typed `IIdentityHubResourceDescriptor` retains its command surface through `DependsOn` chaining.
Audience and client commands are registered on the default control plane and served by the existing
authenticated API endpoint, with POST/DELETE and JSON refusal observations. Owner must equal the
authenticated application issuer; transport and bootstrap-token verification are unchanged.

The command registry is written atomically to `registry.json` beside IdentitySigningKey under the
resource data path. Startup restores the registry and control-plane ownership before serving. `Token`
issuance reads the live combined registry of builder-declared and command-declared clients;
discovery and JWKS remain the same issuer surface. Audience removal is rejected while a client uses
it.

Client credentialSource names a resource Secret mount, optionally prefixed with `mount:`. The
declaration stores the mount name, never credential bytes. Hosting reads and hashes the mounted
credential when initializing or updating the registry, so restart requires the mount again. Clients
must reference existing audiences; add the audience before the client. Conflicting resource seeds or
changed client declarations are rejected until the owning declaration is deleted.

## HTTPS endpoint certificate contract (31t)

The enabled resource's `https` listener consumes the shared Hosting.Resources endpoint certificate
accessor. Endpoint metadata identifies an ordinary Secret mount (default `tls`), carrying one PEM
leaf/private-key/chain document; existing hand-authored IdentityHub and LogSpace bundles retain the
same format. Empty mounts are absent; malformed or multi-key bundles fail. TLS options are composed
in Hosting from the returned leaf and chain, with no hosting-isolation exemptions or dependency
changes. Plain application composition is unchanged. The existing loopback Local fallback and
plaintext restriction remain; production errors continue to name tls.

## Optional telemetry (31b)

The registered resource constructor calls ResourceTelemetry.Configure using the invocation snapshot.
With no gateway or telemetry endpoint, existing providers and hosted services are unchanged. When
enabled, the shared Hosting.Telemetry sibling adds OTLP/HTTP JSON logging and a service registered
before producers; reverse `StopAsync` drains producers before a flush bounded by five seconds and the
host shutdown token. Logging remains composed only in Hosting. See
libraries/Hosting/`Assimalign.Cohesion.Hosting.Telemetry`/docs/DESIGN.md for ordering and protocol
limits.

## Concrete composition (T10 / O34)

`IdentityHubApplication.CreateBuilder(args)` returns the public concrete
`IdentityHubApplicationBuilder`; its `Build()` returns the public
`IdentityHubApplication : Host<IdentityHubApplicationContext>`. The public
`IdentityHubApplicationContext` implements `IIdentityHubApplicationContext`, reading
`ContentRootPath` from the host environment. The application explicitly forwards the root lifecycle
contract to `IHost`, and consumers use the concrete application for `RunAsync` and `await using`.
Runtime options and supporting services remain internal.

Background-work registration belongs to the concrete `IdentityHubApplicationBuilder`:
`AddService(IHostService)` and `AddService(Func<IdentityHubApplicationContext, IHostService>)`. The
factory receives the same concrete context as Web's and `Database`'s `AddService`, so hosting consumers
can use environment, state, and hosted-service members beyond the small root contract. Factories run
once per build against the same context retained by the application; the hosted-service snapshot is
installed after factory evaluation. Services start in registration order and stop in reverse. No
area-owned service abstraction is introduced.

The base host owns the already-cancelled run semantic: one complete start and graceful stop with
fresh lifecycle tokens, normal run-observer notifications, and a final Stopped state. The concrete
application and IHost route share it. Startup failures still roll back and propagate.
