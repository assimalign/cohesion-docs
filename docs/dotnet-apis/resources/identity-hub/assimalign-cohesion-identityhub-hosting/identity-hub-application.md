# IdentityHubApplication

The `IdentityHubApplication` type belongs to `Assimalign.Cohesion.IdentityHub.Hosting`.

> **Status:** Implemented.

Namespace: `Assimalign.Cohesion.IdentityHub.Hosting`

Assembly: `Assimalign.Cohesion.IdentityHub.Hosting`

`IdentityHubApplication.CreateBuilder(args)` creates the code-first IdentityHub builder for the
executable resource assembly. `Build` validates registrations, captures ambient resource inputs,
resolves the `https` endpoint and `data` mount, materializes additional services in registration
order, and appends the built-in issuer service.

The issuer is registered with ResourceRuntime when a generated default control plane exists.
`--endpoint` and `--data` provide standalone overrides when no corresponding ambient input is
present. A materialized `tls` mount supplies production PEM certificate material; the built-in
self-signed fallback and device-approval page are restricted to loopback Local.

## Concrete composition (T10 / O34)

`IdentityHubApplication.CreateBuilder(args)` returns the public concrete
`IdentityHubApplicationBuilder`; its `Build()` returns the public
`IdentityHubApplication : Host<IdentityHubApplicationContext>`. The public
`IdentityHubApplicationContext` implements `IIdentityHubApplicationContext`, reading
`ContentRootPath` from the host environment. The application explicitly forwards the root lifecycle
contract to `IHost`, and consumers use the concrete application for `RunAsync` and `await using`.
Runtime options and supporting services remain internal.

Background-work registration belongs to the concrete `IdentityHubApplicationBuilder`:
`AddService(IHostService)` and `AddService(Func<IdentityHubApplicationContext, IHostService>)`. The
factory receives the same concrete context as Web's and `Database`'s `AddService`, so hosting consumers
can use environment, state, and hosted-service members beyond the small root contract. Factories run
once per build against the same context retained by the application; the hosted-service snapshot is
installed after factory evaluation. Services start in registration order and stop in reverse. No
area-owned service abstraction is introduced.
