# Assimalign.Cohesion.EmailHub design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.EmailHub`.

> **Status:** Partial.

## Design intent

The area root owns only the contracts that feature packages compose against.
`IEmailHubApplicationBuilder` is the contract-only builder seam, while `IEmailHubApplication`
supplies the hosting-free application lifecycle.

## Hosting isolation

The root contracts are hosting-free (O34): `IEmailHubApplication` exposes `Context`, `StartAsync`,
and `StopAsync`; `IEmailHubApplicationContext` exposes `ContentRootPath`.
`IEmailHubApplicationBuilder` exposes `Build()`; it currently declares no area-specific verbs. The
root and feature packages reference no `Assimalign.Cohesion.Hosting*` library; `COHRES004` enforces
the boundary.

The concrete application, builder, and context live in `Assimalign.Cohesion.EmailHub.Hosting`;
options and supporting services remain internal.

## Composition lifecycle

Background-work registration belongs to the concrete `EmailHubApplicationBuilder`:
`AddService(IHostService)` and `AddService(Func<EmailHubApplicationContext, IHostService>)`. The
factory receives the same concrete context as Web's and `Database`'s `AddService`, so hosting consumers
can use environment, state, and hosted-service members beyond the small root contract. Factories run
once per build against the same context retained by the application; the hosted-service snapshot is
installed after factory evaluation. Services start in registration order and stop in reverse. No
area-owned service abstraction is introduced.

Enabled resources retain their ambient context and registered control-plane behavior; plain
application defaults are described by the Hosting design.

## AOT posture

The contracts require no reflection, dynamic code generation, runtime assembly scanning, or
container-based activation and remain safe for trimming and NativeAOT.

## Hosting-free application contract (O34)

`EmailHubApplication.CreateBuilder(args)` returns the public concrete `EmailHubApplicationBuilder`;
its `Build()` returns the public `EmailHubApplication : Host<EmailHubApplicationContext>`. The
public `EmailHubApplicationContext` implements `IEmailHubApplicationContext`, reading
`ContentRootPath` from the host environment. The application explicitly forwards the root lifecycle
contract to `IHost`, and consumers use the concrete application for `RunAsync` and `await using`.
Runtime options and supporting services remain internal.

Background-work registration (`AddService`) is available only on the concrete Hosting builder.
