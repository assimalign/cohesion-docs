## Summary

This project defines the public, contract-only builder and application lifecycle seam for the
EmailHub area. The implementation and creation entry point live in
`Assimalign.Cohesion.EmailHub.Hosting`.

## Public surface

- **`IEmailHubApplicationBuilder`** — owns area declarations and builds an `IEmailHubApplication`.
- **`IEmailHubApplication`** — exposes `Context`, `StartAsync`, and `StopAsync`.

The current application remains a filler with no area behavior or hosted services registered by
default. Consumers can add explicit lifecycle services through the concrete Hosting builder;
email-hub behavior is outside this slice.

## Hosting-free application contract (O34)

The root contracts are hosting-free (O34): `IEmailHubApplication` exposes `Context`, `StartAsync`,
and `StopAsync`; `IEmailHubApplicationContext` exposes `ContentRootPath`.
`IEmailHubApplicationBuilder` exposes `Build()`; it currently declares no area-specific verbs. The
root and feature packages reference no `Assimalign.Cohesion.Hosting*` library; `COHRES004` enforces
the boundary.

`EmailHubApplication.CreateBuilder(args)` returns the public concrete `EmailHubApplicationBuilder`;
its `Build()` returns the public `EmailHubApplication : Host<EmailHubApplicationContext>`. The
public `EmailHubApplicationContext` implements `IEmailHubApplicationContext`, reading
`ContentRootPath` from the host environment. The application explicitly forwards the root lifecycle
contract to `IHost`, and consumers use the concrete application for `RunAsync` and `await using`.
Runtime options and supporting services remain internal.

Background-work registration (`AddService`) is available only on the concrete Hosting builder.
