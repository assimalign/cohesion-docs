# Assimalign.Cohesion.NatGateway.ApplicationModel design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.NatGateway.ApplicationModel`.

> **Status:** Partial.

`NatGatewayResource` wraps a manifest snapshot and typed `NatGatewayResourceOptions`, and delegates to
its internal planner. `AddNatGateway` returns `INatGatewayResourceDescriptor`, a thin graph-descriptor
wrapper retaining dependencies and the built plan. The planner validates the kind, Deployment
workload, declared area endpoint schemes/protocols, and http control plane at /cohesion/v1, then
delegates realization to GenericPlanner. Endpoint ports, extra endpoints, secret/configuration
mounts, and generic deployer options remain manifest-driven; no platform types are referenced.

SDK defaults are http/tcp:8080 and a Deployment. Replica counts use generic manifest limits; there
is no Scheduler singleton constraint. The SDK keeps artifact.composable=false; the planner does not
reinterpret that artifact fact.

`NatGatewayResourceControlPlane.Create` returns a fresh Hosting.Resources control plane with no
accepted command kinds. Runtime Hosting discovers the generated registration and serves its protocol
through the private Web.Hosting.Resources feature. Unsupported command envelopes are refused with
501; domain commands are deferred to item 31c.

The package is NuGet-only (developer-experience design D4/O2), never a framework member. Its only
direct dependencies are ApplicationModel and Hosting.Resources; `COHAM001` checks its full resolved
closure. Public resource/options values follow PlannedResource and ResourceOptions; the descriptor
is interface-first and its implementation is internal. No runtime hosting, DI, reflection
serialization, or gateway implementation enters this package.
