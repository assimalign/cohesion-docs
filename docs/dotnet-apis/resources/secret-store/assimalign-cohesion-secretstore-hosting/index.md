# Assimalign.Cohesion.SecretStore.Hosting

Provides the SecretStore runtime: `SecretStoreApplication.CreateBuilder(args)`, protected durable secret/trust/certificate storage, an ECDSA certificate authority, and the HTTP data and control protocol served on the resource's `api` endpoint.

> **Status:** Partial.

## Summary

Provides the SecretStore runtime: `SecretStoreApplication.CreateBuilder(args)`, protected durable
secret/trust/certificate storage, an ECDSA certificate authority, and the HTTP data and control
protocol served on the resource's `api` endpoint.

## Current behavior

- **Captures the ambient `ResourceRuntime.Current`** — context when the builder is created and honors
  its `api` endpoint, `data` mount, identity, environment, application trust key, and registered
  control plane.
- **Always appends an HTTP/1** — endpoint service after caller-registered host services, so the endpoint
  starts last and drains first.
- **Authenticates gateway-managed `/cohesion/v1/*` calls** — with trusted ES256 bootstrap JWTs and
  distinguishes unauthenticated (`401`) from wrong-audience (`403`) requests.
- **Interoperates with `SecretStore.Client` for** — secret reads, durable leaf-certificate reads, and the
  `cohesion.trust.add` command.
- **Protects secrets, issuer state,** — CA keys, pending enrollment keys, and leaf bundles at rest.
- **`Supports`** — durable standalone CA self-seeding and explicit request/sign/complete intermediate-CA
  enrollment with optional Platform-root pinning.
- **Renews named leaves on** — resolution and checks the HTTPS transport leaf at listener startup; a
  continuously running host must restart before transport expiry until the shared TLS listener
  supports asynchronous certificate selection per handshake.

## Configuration

Endpoint precedence is registered-control-plane observation, ambient `api`, `--endpoint`, then
`https://127.0.0.1:8443`. Data-path precedence is ambient `data` mount, `--data`, then
`<content-root>/data`. Plaintext HTTP is permitted only on loopback in `Local`. A standalone host
has no bootstrap credential and therefore may bind only to loopback, including when it uses HTTPS.

Builder-declared secrets seed missing durable entries. `AddCertificateAuthority` controls the
standalone root common name, initial certificate/key material, pending Platform enrollment, Platform
root pin, and standalone self-seeding. Durable authority state takes precedence on restart.

The persistent volume's file-system ACL protects the colocated DataProtection key ring; an external
KMS/wrapping-key integration and protected-record rewrap migration remain future work.

## Known gap

The configured Platform enrollment endpoint is not called automatically. A gateway/operator must
drive the three enrollment routes, deliver trust grants, and provide an out-of-band root for the
first HTTPS connection. A pending child also cannot start that HTTPS listener before it owns an
enrolled or provisional transport identity; the loopback HTTP enrollment path is Local-only.
`certs/public` /ACME issuance and gateway `parameter:` certificate mounts are also not implemented
by this host. See [DESIGN.md](design.md) for the exact routes and bootstrap boundary.

## Public types

- **`SecretStoreApplication`** — concrete host and creation entry point.
- **`SecretStoreApplicationBuilder`** — composition and background-work registration.
- **`SecretStoreApplicationContext`** — host environment and runtime state.

## Commands

| Wire kind | Descriptor verb | Ownership key |
|---|---|---|
| `secretstore.add-secret` | `AddSecret` | secret path |
| `secretstore.issue-certificate` | `IssueCertificate` | certificate name |

`AddSecret` declarations carry only a source reference. `parameter:<name>` resolves through the
gateway's existing parameter provider before delivery. `<resource>:<key>` uses the existing store
resolver and requires a declared dependency and an available source endpoint. `literal:<value>` is
rejected during declaration construction: literal secret material never enters the desired model,
deterministic id or manifest. Only the transient delivery envelope contains resolved bytes; the
protected repository stores the value and source together. An unresolved source is a named Rejected
result. Original source-only commands remain the gateway's declaration ledger.

`IssueCertificate` honors the supplied subject and SAN set. An existing certificate with different
identity is rejected until deleted; renewal preserves its identity. Private key and leaf storage
reuse the existing protected CA repository.

The control plane also accepts `cohesion.trust.add`, which the SDK manifest deliberately does not
advertise. It is the gateway-owned trust channel through IGatewayStoreClient, never a `Build`-declared
application command. Trust keeps owner `issuer@subject`, POST-only behavior, empty 204 success,
empty 409 conflict and existing 403 authorization refusals. `New` commands use owner `issuer`, accept
POST and DELETE, return 200 application/octet-stream on success, and JSON `{status,detail}`
refusals. Malformed command envelopes return 400 with that JSON refusal shape, including invalid
base64 payloads. The client accepts empty successful responses as Applied (Deleted for DELETE);
legacy `SendCommandAsync` continues to work. This owner split lets local gateway declarations
authenticate end to end.

Restricted trust grants accept `{trustKey,allowedCommandKinds}` while unrestricted grants retain the
bare JWK payload. The protected trust document round-trips the optional string array; absent or
empty means every command kind is allowed. Enroll(platformStore) is deferred to item 31t: automatic
Platform enrollment needs a gateway-owned mediator and Platform-audience signer.

## Concrete composition (T10 / O34)

`SecretStoreApplication.CreateBuilder(args)` returns the public concrete
`SecretStoreApplicationBuilder`; its `Build()` returns the public
`SecretStoreApplication : Host<SecretStoreApplicationContext>`. The public
`SecretStoreApplicationContext` implements `ISecretStoreApplicationContext`, reading
`ContentRootPath` from the host environment. The application explicitly forwards the root lifecycle
contract to `IHost`, and consumers use the concrete application for `RunAsync` and `await using`.
Runtime options and supporting services remain internal.

Background-work registration belongs to the concrete `SecretStoreApplicationBuilder`:
`AddService(IHostService)` and `AddService(Func<SecretStoreApplicationContext, IHostService>)`. The
factory receives the same concrete context as Web's and `Database`'s `AddService`, so hosting consumers
can use environment, state, and hosted-service members beyond the small root contract. Factories run
once per build against the same context retained by the application; the hosted-service snapshot is
installed after factory evaluation. Services start in registration order and stop in reverse. No
area-owned service abstraction is introduced.

The base host owns the already-cancelled run semantic: one complete start and graceful stop with
fresh lifecycle tokens, normal run-observer notifications, and a final Stopped state. The concrete
application and IHost route share it. Startup failures still roll back and propagate.
