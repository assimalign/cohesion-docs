# Assimalign.Cohesion.SecretStore.Hosting design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.SecretStore.Hosting`.

> **Status:** Partial.

## Design intent

The hosting module is the SecretStore runtime and protocol boundary.
`SecretStoreApplication.CreateBuilder(args)` returns the public concrete
`SecretStoreApplicationBuilder`; its `Build()` returns the public
`SecretStoreApplication : Host<SecretStoreApplicationContext>`. The public
`SecretStoreApplicationContext` implements `ISecretStoreApplicationContext`, reading
`ContentRootPath` from the host environment. The application explicitly forwards the root lifecycle
contract to `IHost`, and consumers use the concrete application for `RunAsync` and `await using`.
Runtime options and supporting services remain internal. Persistence, the certificate-authority
manager, issuer store, and endpoint service remain internal.

The builder captures the current `ResourceRuntime.Current` context when it is created. Tests and
in-process callers therefore install a per-invocation context with
`ResourceRuntime.CreateScope(...)` before calling `CreateBuilder`. When a control-plane factory is
registered for the resource assembly, the builder creates it, publishes the built host through
`ResourceRuntime.HostBuilt`, and serves its health, observed-endpoint, stop, and command surface. A
disabled/plain executable has no registered control plane and still gets the SecretStore data
protocol.

## Composition and endpoint selection

`Local` is the developer-machine environment. `Development` is a deployable environment and requires
HTTPS even on loopback, as does `Production`. An unset environment still resolves to `Production`.

Every build materializes caller-added `IHostService` factories once, in registration order, then
appends one `SecretsEndpointService`. The shared host starts in that order and stops in reverse, so
the data endpoint starts last and drains first. A builder may be built only once.

The `api` endpoint is selected in this order:

1. an already observed `api` endpoint from the registered control plane;
2. the ambient resource context's `api` endpoint;
3. `--endpoint <uri>` or `--endpoint=<uri>`;
4. `https://127.0.0.1:8443`.

Only absolute `http` and `https` endpoint URIs are accepted. Hosts must be `localhost` or a bindable
IP address. Plaintext HTTP is restricted to loopback in the `Local` environment; HTTPS is otherwise
required. An unauthenticated standalone store is loopback-only for either scheme. A non-root path on
the endpoint URI becomes a prefix for every route below.

The durable data directory is selected from the ambient `data` mount, then `--data`, then
`<content-root>/data`. The mount must expose a file-system path. Command-line values are snapshots
owned by the builder and malformed or missing values fail during build.

## HTTP protocol

The host implements these routes over a real HTTP/1 listener:

| `Route` | Methods | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/livez` | `GET`, `HEAD` | Compatibility health routes. Readiness additionally requires a started host and an enrolled CA. |
| `/cohesion/v1/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/livez` | `GET`, `HEAD` | Authenticated namespaced health reports. |
| `/cohesion/v1/endpoints` | `GET`, `HEAD` | Returns observed endpoint strings. |
| `/cohesion/v1/stop` | `POST` | Requests control-plane stop, or returns `404` without a registered control plane. |
| `/cohesion/v1/secrets?path=<path>` | `GET`, `HEAD` | Reads protected secret bytes. `trusted-issuers.json` exports the current issuer document. |
| `/cohesion/v1/certificates?name=<name>` | `GET`, `HEAD` | Returns the root (`ca/root`) or a durable leaf bundle (`certs/<one-segment-name>`). |
| `/cohesion/v1/commands` | `GET`, `HEAD`, `POST`, `DELETE` | Lists accepted kinds; mutates declared secrets/certificates; trust grants retain POST-only behavior. |
| `/cohesion/v1/certificates/enrollment-request` | `GET`, `HEAD` | Returns the pending CSR for `application` and `resource`. |
| `/cohesion/v1/certificates/enroll` | `POST` | An enrolled authority signs a matching intermediate-CA CSR. |
| `/cohesion/v1/certificates/enrollment` | `POST` | Completes a pending enrollment with the issued certificate and issuer chain. |

Unsupported methods return `405` with `Allow`; malformed input returns `400`; unknown namespaced
routes return `404`. Secret and certificate responses are marked `no-store, no-cache`. `HEAD`
follows `GET` validation and headers without writing a body.

`SecretStore.Client` interoperates directly with the secret, certificate, and command routes. The
command JSON contains `id`, `kind`, `owner`, `key`, and base64 `payload`. The implemented
`cohesion.trust.add` command upserts an ES256/P-256 public JWK by issuer. Replacing the ambient
application issuer is rejected, and replacing an issuer owned by another authenticated principal
returns `409`.

## Bootstrap authentication

Authentication is enabled when the ambient context names a gateway. At startup the host requires an
application name, resource name, and public application trust JWK, and durably installs that
application as a trusted issuer. Every `/cohesion/v1/*` request then requires a bearer JWT signed by
a trusted ES256/P-256 key. The token requires `iss`, `sub`, `aud`, `exp`, `nbf`, `iat`, and
`jti`, has a maximum 24-hour lifetime, and must name the current resource as an audience. Secret,
certificate, trust-command, lifecycle, and child-enrollment operations additionally require the
ambient application's issuer. Only the Platform intermediate-signing route accepts a trusted peer
issuer, and its request application must equal that authenticated issuer.

Missing, malformed, expired, untrusted, or incorrectly signed credentials return `401` and a
`WWW-Authenticate: Bearer` challenge. A valid token for the wrong audience returns `403`. Trust
commands must set `owner` to `<iss>@<sub>`; declared secret and certificate commands use `<iss>`.
Standalone hosts (no gateway name) do not require bearer authentication and therefore may bind only
to loopback. Plaintext HTTP is allowed only on loopback in `Local`, regardless of hosting mode.
This is bootstrap credential authentication, not a general user authorization or secret-policy
engine.

## Protected persistence and certificate authority

Secrets, trusted issuers, CA state, pending enrollment private keys, and leaf bundles are written
through `Assimalign.Cohesion.Security.DataProtection`. The key ring is durable below the data
directory and is discriminated by application and resource identity. Builder-declared secrets seed
only absent paths; existing durable values win on restart. Trust upserts are persisted before the
live issuer map changes.

The file-system ACL on the `data` volume remains the confidentiality boundary for the key ring; this
item does not add an external KMS or hardware-backed wrapping key. Files and directories are
restricted to their owner on POSIX. Keys rotate lazily on a 90-day lifetime. Until durable records
gain a rewrap migration, the store retains a long unprotect grace period so ordinary key rotation
cannot make an existing protected record unreadable.

CA initialization precedence is durable authority state, explicitly supplied certificate/private key
material, configured Platform enrollment, then standalone self-seeding. A self-seeded root is an
ECDSA P-256 CA. Leaf requests are issued on first resolution and persisted as PEM containing the
leaf private key and full issuer chain. Named leaves renew lazily on resolution within seven days of
expiration. A transport leaf is checked and renewed when the HTTPS listener starts; until the shared
TLS listener supports asynchronous per-handshake certificate selection, a continuously running store
must restart before that leaf expires. `ca/root` returns the terminal root. `certs/public` is
deliberately `501 Not Implemented`: ACME/public-CA issuance is outside the current runtime.

The private HTTPS endpoint certificate covers its bind host, resource name, generic-planner API
Service name, and both short and cluster-local Kubernetes Service DNS forms. The Platform/public
root still must be distributed to clients by the gateway trust bootstrap described below.

Platform enrollment is a safe explicit three-step protocol: the child creates and persists a CSR and
private key; an enrolled parent validates the requested application/resource subject and signs an
intermediate CA; the child verifies the returned certificate, chain, and optional pinned Platform
root before committing it and deleting pending state. A configured enrollment failure never falls
back to a new self-signed root.

## Explicit bootstrap gap

`PlatformEnrollmentEndpoint` selects pending-enrollment mode. Gateway-driven automatic enrollment
remains deferred at the client request/response seam; the store's CSR, signing, and completion
routes already exist. The gateway now supplies a provisional transport certificate and trusted
anchors, so a pending child can serve HTTPS before its own authority is enrolled. Readiness remains
unhealthy until enrollment completes. The listener chooses the contract certificate first and its
own CA second. Parameter-supplied certificates are resolved by the gateway; `public` remains
reserved for later ACME integration. Default issued leaves include localhost and both loopback IP
SANs so local clients can validate the same application certificate; explicitly supplied SANs remain
authoritative.

## Boundaries and AOT posture

The host references the SecretStore root plus cross-area hosting, HTTP, identity-token,
data-protection, and Web runtime infrastructure. Those cross-area runtime dependencies are private
implementation details. It does not reference SecretStore.ApplicationModel; the generated enabled
resource registers that package's control plane through Hosting.Resources. JSON used by the endpoint
is written explicitly, persistence uses fixed internal formats, and construction uses no dynamic
activation. The implementation remains trimming- and NativeAOT-oriented.

## Declarative commands (item 31c)

| Wire kind | Descriptor verb | Ownership key |
|---|---|---|
| `secretstore.add-secret` | `AddSecret` | secret path |
| `secretstore.issue-certificate` | `IssueCertificate` | certificate name |

Kinds use verb-noun kebab under the area prefix. The examples `rezolvr.record` and
`identityhub.audience` in developer-experience design section 7 are illustrative; item 27's design
rewrite should reflect the landed convention. Manifest commands remain bare JSON strings. Typed
verbs validate argument shape and use source-generated JSON metadata. `Build` validates the advertised
kind, canonical payload, deterministic id, and uniqueness of the target ownership key. The default
control plane handles id replay and owner isolation; each area handler also accepts an identical
reapplication with a different id. Conflicts return named Rejected details.

`AddSecret` declarations carry only a source reference. `parameter:<name>` resolves through the
gateway's existing parameter provider before delivery. `<resource>:<key>` uses the existing store
resolver and requires a declared dependency and an available source endpoint. `literal:<value>` is
rejected during declaration construction: literal secret material never enters the desired model,
deterministic id or manifest. Only the transient delivery envelope contains resolved bytes; the
protected repository stores the value and source together. An unresolved source is a named Rejected
result. Original source-only commands remain the gateway's declaration ledger.

`IssueCertificate` honors the supplied subject and SAN set. An existing certificate with different
identity is rejected until deleted; renewal preserves its identity. Private key and leaf storage
reuse the existing protected CA repository.

The control plane also accepts `cohesion.trust.add`, which the SDK manifest deliberately does not
advertise. It is the gateway-owned trust channel through IGatewayStoreClient, never a `Build`-declared
application command. Trust keeps owner `issuer@subject`, POST-only behavior, empty 204 success,
empty 409 conflict and existing 403 authorization refusals. `New` commands use owner `issuer`, accept
POST and DELETE, return 200 application/octet-stream on success, and JSON `{status,detail}`
refusals. Malformed command envelopes return 400 with that JSON refusal shape, including invalid
base64 payloads. The client accepts empty successful responses as Applied (Deleted for DELETE);
legacy `SendCommandAsync` continues to work. This owner split lets local gateway declarations
authenticate end to end.

Restricted trust grants accept `{trustKey,allowedCommandKinds}` while unrestricted grants retain the
bare JWK payload. The protected trust document round-trips the optional string array; absent or
empty means every command kind is allowed. Enroll(platformStore) remains deferred after item 31t:
automatic Platform enrollment needs a gateway-owned mediator and Platform-audience signer.

## HTTPS endpoint certificate contract (31t)

The enabled resource's `api` listener consumes the shared Hosting.Resources endpoint certificate
accessor. Endpoint metadata identifies an ordinary Secret mount (default `tls`), carrying one PEM
leaf/private-key/chain document; existing hand-authored IdentityHub and LogSpace bundles retain the
same format. Empty mounts are absent; malformed or multi-key bundles fail. TLS options are composed
in Hosting from the returned leaf and chain, with no hosting-isolation exemptions or dependency
changes. Plain application composition is unchanged. The mounted transport certificate wins before
the store-owned CA fallback, so pending intermediate enrollment can expose its HTTPS listener
independently of CA readiness.

## Optional telemetry (31b)

The registered resource constructor calls ResourceTelemetry.Configure using the invocation snapshot.
With no gateway or telemetry endpoint, existing providers and hosted services are unchanged. When
enabled, the shared Hosting.Telemetry sibling adds OTLP/HTTP JSON logging and a service registered
before producers; reverse `StopAsync` drains producers before a flush bounded by five seconds and the
host shutdown token. Logging remains composed only in Hosting. See
libraries/Hosting/`Assimalign.Cohesion.Hosting.Telemetry`/docs/DESIGN.md for ordering and protocol
limits.

## Concrete composition (T10 / O34)

Background-work registration belongs to the concrete `SecretStoreApplicationBuilder`:
`AddService(IHostService)` and `AddService(Func<SecretStoreApplicationContext, IHostService>)`. The
factory receives the same concrete context as Web's and `Database`'s `AddService`, so hosting consumers
can use environment, state, and hosted-service members beyond the small root contract. Factories run
once per build against the same context retained by the application; the hosted-service snapshot is
installed after factory evaluation. Services start in registration order and stop in reverse. No
area-owned service abstraction is introduced.

The base host owns the already-cancelled run semantic: one complete start and graceful stop with
fresh lifecycle tokens, normal run-observer notifications, and a final Stopped state. The concrete
application and IHost route share it. Startup failures still roll back and propagate.
