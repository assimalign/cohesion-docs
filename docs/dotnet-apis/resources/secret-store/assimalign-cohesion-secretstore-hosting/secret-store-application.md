# SecretStoreApplication

The `SecretStoreApplication` type belongs to `Assimalign.Cohesion.SecretStore.Hosting`.

> **Status:** Partial.

Namespace: `Assimalign.Cohesion.SecretStore.Hosting` Assembly:
`Assimalign.Cohesion.SecretStore.Hosting`

## Purpose

`SecretStoreApplication` is the public concrete application and creation entry point for the
SecretStore runtime. The application, builder, and context are public. Persistence,
certificate-authority, and endpoint types remain internal.

## Factory behavior

- **`CreateBuilder(string[] args)`** — validates the argument array and returns a `SecretStoreApplicationBuilder`.
- **The builder snapshots the** — current `ResourceRuntime.Current` context. In-process callers and tests
  install their invocation with `ResourceRuntime.CreateScope(...)` before calling the factory.
- **`--endpoint <uri>`/`--endpoint=<uri>` and `--data** — <path>`/`--data=<path>` provide standalone
  fallbacks after ambient endpoint and mount values.
- **Building materializes registered service** — factories once in order and appends the protected
  SecretStore HTTP endpoint. The endpoint starts last and drains first.
- **A builder may be** — built only once.

## Exceptions

`CreateBuilder` throws `ArgumentNullException` when `args` is `null`.

## Usage

See the [source-backed usage examples](examples/index.md).

`For` an enabled resource, generated code registers the area control plane through `Hosting.Resources`
; Hosting consumes that registration without referencing `SecretStore.ApplicationModel`.

## Concrete composition (T10 / O34)

`SecretStoreApplication.CreateBuilder(args)` returns the public concrete
`SecretStoreApplicationBuilder`; its `Build()` returns the public
`SecretStoreApplication : Host<SecretStoreApplicationContext>`. The public
`SecretStoreApplicationContext` implements `ISecretStoreApplicationContext`, reading
`ContentRootPath` from the host environment. The application explicitly forwards the root lifecycle
contract to `IHost`, and consumers use the concrete application for `RunAsync` and `await using`.
Runtime options and supporting services remain internal.

Background-work registration belongs to the concrete `SecretStoreApplicationBuilder`:
`AddService(IHostService)` and `AddService(Func<SecretStoreApplicationContext, IHostService>)`. The
factory receives the same concrete context as Web's and `Database`'s `AddService`, so hosting consumers
can use environment, state, and hosted-service members beyond the small root contract. Factories run
once per build against the same context retained by the application; the hosted-service snapshot is
installed after factory evaluation. Services start in registration order and stop in reverse. No
area-owned service abstraction is introduced.
