The AOT-compatible, dependency-guarded orchestration package for Cohesion secret stores. It turns an
enabled secret-store executable's build-produced `ResourceManifest` into a typed
`SecretStoreResource`, applies a deployer-owned storage override, enforces the single-replica
safety boundary, and emits a platform-neutral `ResourcePlan` for the selected gateway compiler.

See the [source-backed usage examples](examples/index.md).

Generated gateway code normally supplies the manifest and exposes these typed options to application
authors.

## Scope

- **`SecretStoreResource`** — a `PlannedResource` over the immutable manifest snapshot.
- **`ISecretStoreResourceDescriptor`** — the area-typed descriptor returned by the
  composition verb.
- **`SecretStoreResourceOptions`** — typed `Storage.Size`; the shared `Replicas` value
  must be unset or one until replication exists.
- **`AddSecretStore(manifest, options)`** — application-graph composition returning the
  typed descriptor whose resource is a `SecretStoreResource`.
- **SecretStore planner** — `StatefulSet`, an HTTP or HTTPS `api` endpoint, a persistent
  `data` Volume, exactly one stable replica, a sized per-replica claim, endpoint
  services, and a headless governing service.
- **`SecretStoreResourceControlPlane`** — the SecretStore default control-plane factory,
  including the generic `cohesion.trust.add` trust-grant operation.

`SecretStore.Hosting` exposes the control plane and store protocol beneath `/cohesion/v1` on `api`.
The transport-neutral plane aggregates health, readiness and liveness, publishes observed endpoints,
and supports graceful stop. Secret and certificate retrieval, trust enrollment, credential
verification, and persistent store behavior remain runtime responsibilities.

The `AddSecret` and `IssueCertificate` descriptor verbs declare source references and certificate
identities. `Enroll(platformStore)` is deferred to item 31t.

## Dependencies

- **`Assimalign.Cohesion.ApplicationModel`** — for manifests, planned resources, and the
  platform-neutral realization-plan IR.
- **`Assimalign.Cohesion.Hosting.Resources`** — for the default-control-plane contract and
  runtime registration seam.

The project is guarded by `COHAM001` and never references SecretStore runtime, gateway, or platform
packages. Runtime endpoint and mount values flow through the shared `Hosting.Resources` context
rather than SecretStore-specific environment variables.

## Commands

| Wire kind | Descriptor verb | Ownership key |
|---|---|---|
| `secretstore.add-secret` | `AddSecret` | secret path |
| `secretstore.issue-certificate` | `IssueCertificate` | certificate name |

`AddSecret` declarations carry only a source reference. `parameter:<name>` resolves through the
gateway's existing parameter provider before delivery. `<resource>:<key>` uses the existing store
resolver and requires a declared dependency and an available source endpoint. `literal:<value>` is
rejected during declaration construction: literal secret material never enters the desired model,
deterministic id or manifest. Only the transient delivery envelope contains resolved bytes; the
protected repository stores the value and source together. An unresolved source is a named Rejected
result. Original source-only commands remain the gateway's declaration ledger.

`IssueCertificate` honors the supplied subject and SAN set. An existing certificate with different
identity is rejected until deleted; renewal preserves its identity. Private key and leaf storage
reuse the existing protected CA repository.

The control plane also accepts `cohesion.trust.add`, which the SDK manifest deliberately does not
advertise. It is the gateway-owned trust channel through IGatewayStoreClient, never a `Build`-declared
application command. Trust keeps owner `issuer@subject`, POST-only behavior, empty 204 success,
empty 409 conflict and existing 403 authorization refusals. `New` commands use owner `issuer`, accept
POST and DELETE, return 200 application/octet-stream on success, and JSON `{status,detail}`
refusals. The client accepts empty successful responses as Applied (Deleted for DELETE); legacy
`SendCommandAsync` continues to work. This owner split lets local gateway declarations authenticate
end to end.

Restricted trust grants accept `{trustKey,allowedCommandKinds}` while unrestricted grants retain the
bare JWK payload. The protected trust document round-trips the optional string array; absent or
empty means every command kind is allowed. Enroll(platformStore) is deferred to item 31t: automatic
Platform enrollment needs a gateway-owned mediator and Platform-audience signer.
