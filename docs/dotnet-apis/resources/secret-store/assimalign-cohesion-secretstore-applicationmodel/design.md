# Assimalign.Cohesion.SecretStore.ApplicationModel design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.SecretStore.ApplicationModel`.

> **Status:** Partial.

## Design intent

This project is the SecretStore area's AOT-compatible, dependency-guarded orchestration package. It
gives a gateway a typed secret-store resource, a platform-neutral realization planner, and the
default-control-plane factory that every orchestration-enabled secret-store executable registers. It
never references `SecretStore.Hosting`, a gateway implementation, or a platform object model.

An enabled `Sdk.SecretStore` executable produces `cohesion/resource/v1` at build time. Generated
gateway code passes that `ResourceManifest` to `AddSecretStore(...)`; this package does not
reconstruct artifact, endpoint, mount, or lifecycle facts from executable naming conventions.

## Family and dependency direction

- **`Assimalign.Cohesion.SecretStore`** — owns the application and secret-store contracts.
- **`Assimalign.Cohesion.SecretStore.Hosting`** — implements the resource runtime, protocol,
  persistence, trust, and certificate workflows.
- **`Assimalign.Cohesion.SecretStore.Client`** — is the thin gateway-side protocol client.
- **`Assimalign.Cohesion.SecretStore.ApplicationModel`** — describes the resource to an
  orchestrator and supplies its default control-plane contract.

The ApplicationModel package does not reference any of the other three. Its only direct Cohesion
references are `Assimalign.Cohesion.ApplicationModel` and `Assimalign.Cohesion.Hosting.Resources`.
The enabled customer executable is the composition root that receives both the runtime and generated
control-plane registration.

## Manifest-backed resource

`SecretStoreResource` derives from `PlannedResource`. The base snapshots the supplied
`ResourceManifest` and projects its executable, endpoint, and mount compatibility surfaces. The
manifest remains the source of truth for:

- **executable or image** — identity;
- **the `api`** — endpoint;
- **the persistent `data` mount** — and declared size;
- **lifecycle limits, application identity,** — settings, references, and extra
  non-persistent mounts or endpoints; and
- **the default control-plane location,** — `api` plus `/cohesion/v1`.

`SecretStoreResourceOptions` derives from the shared `ResourceOptions` and exposes only
deployer-owned planning overrides. `Storage.Size` overrides the `data` claim's `mounts[].size`
value. The inherited `Replicas` property remains part of the shared options shape, but the effective
replica count must be one. The planner rejects any manifest or deployer override that requests
multiple replicas because the store does not yet implement replication or consensus. Ports, mount
paths, endpoint exposure, and arbitrary environment values remain executable-owned manifest facts.

## SecretStore planner

`SecretStoreResource.CreatePlan(PlanContext)` is reported as `SecretStore planner` in
application-build diagnostics. Before generic trait mapping, the planner requires:

- **manifest kind `SecretStore`, compared** — ordinally;
- **a `StatefulSet`** — workload;
- **an effective replica count** — of exactly one;
- **an `api` endpoint using** — HTTP or HTTPS over TCP;
- **exactly one persistent Volume,** — named `data`; and
- **the default control plane** — on `api` at `/cohesion/v1`.

Additional endpoints and non-persistent Configuration or Secret mounts remain legal manifest facts.
This permits, for example, a metrics endpoint or a parameter-backed TLS mount without weakening the
single persistent data-owner invariant.

The shared generic planner then produces `cohesion/plan/v1`. The area planner verifies the
resulting stateful shape: exactly one replica with stable workload identity, one sized per-replica
`data` claim, one ordinary API service, and exactly one portless, headless governing service. A
checked-in golden plan pins the default compiler-facing IR shape.

The result contains only Cohesion realization-plan records. Kubernetes StatefulSets, claims and
Services, Docker volumes, and local directories are produced later by the selected platform
compiler.

## Composition API

`AddSecretStore(manifest, options)` creates a `SecretStoreResource`, applies typed planning
options, and adds it to the application graph. The returned `ISecretStoreResourceDescriptor`
delegates to the descriptor identity owned by the base graph while exposing `Resource` as the typed
`SecretStoreResource`. Planning remains deferred until `IApplicationBuilder.Build()` so the planner
receives the selected environment and final referenced-manifest map.

See the [source-backed usage examples](examples/index.md).

Generated gateway verbs supply the manifest and expose the same optional typed options; application
authors normally do not load the JSON themselves.

## Default control plane and protocol boundary

`SecretStoreResourceControlPlane.Create()` returns a fresh `Hosting.Resources.IResourceControlPlane`
. The enabled resource's generated `ResourceControlPlane.g.cs` registers that factory with
`ResourceRuntime` and seeds it with the invocation's observed endpoints. `SecretStore.Hosting` reads
the registration through the shared seam and serves it on the manifest's `api` endpoint; neither
package references the other.

The transport-neutral plane supplies health, readiness, liveness, observed endpoints, graceful stop,
and command discovery. Hosting exposes those operations together with secret reads, certificate
reads, trust-grant enrollment, and the store's protocol under `/cohesion/v1`. Bootstrap Bearer
credentials authenticate managed requests; credential verification and authorization remain in
Hosting.

The plane accepts `cohesion.trust.add` for gateway trust bootstrap and the desired-state commands
`secretstore.add-secret` and `secretstore.issue-certificate`. Only the two desired-state kinds are
advertised in the SDK manifest. Enroll(platformStore) is deferred to item 31t.

## Security ownership

The declarative plane carries no secret bytes, private keys, bootstrap tokens, or certificate
material. `Root`-CA self-seeding, per-application trusted issuers, credential verification,
intermediate-CA enrollment, leaf issuance, rotation, and at-rest persistence are runtime behavior in
`SecretStore.Hosting`.

The `cohesion.trust.add` identifier is a declarative compatibility fact, not an authorization
decision. Hosting validates the bootstrap credential and enrollment request before it changes the
trusted-issuer set.

## AOT posture

`COHAM001` constrains the complete production dependency closure to `Assimalign.Cohesion.Core`,
`Assimalign.Cohesion.ApplicationModel`, plain Hosting, `Hosting.Health`, `Hosting.Resources`, the
permitted ProtectedData facade, and BCL assemblies. The planner uses typed records and ordinary
loops only. Golden serialization uses `ResourcePlanJsonContext`; there is no reflection, runtime
code generation, SecretStore runtime dependency, or platform SDK dependency.

## Non-goals

- **Hosting the API, health** — endpoints, storage engine, or secret-store protocol.
- **Carrying secret values, credentials,** — private keys, certificates, or trust grants in
  the manifest or realization plan.
- **Inventing a manifest from** — a resource name or executable-name convention.
- **Carrying platform-specific scheduling, storage-class,** — Service, or claim types.
- **Client factories or remote** — protocol calls; those belong to `SecretStore.Client`.
- **Horizontal scaling or high** — availability before a replication and consensus
  protocol is implemented.
- **Automatic Platform enrollment before** — the item 31t certificate contract.

## Declarative commands (item 31c)

| Wire kind | Descriptor verb | Ownership key |
|---|---|---|
| `secretstore.add-secret` | `AddSecret` | secret path |
| `secretstore.issue-certificate` | `IssueCertificate` | certificate name |

Kinds use verb-noun kebab under the area prefix. The examples `rezolvr.record` and
`identityhub.audience` in developer-experience design section 7 are illustrative; item 27's design
rewrite should reflect the landed convention. Manifest commands remain bare JSON strings. Typed
verbs validate argument shape and use source-generated JSON metadata. `Build` validates the advertised
kind, canonical payload, deterministic id, and uniqueness of the target ownership key. The default
control plane handles id replay and owner isolation; each area handler also accepts an identical
reapplication with a different id. Conflicts return named Rejected details.

`AddSecret` declarations carry only a source reference. `parameter:<name>` resolves through the
gateway's existing parameter provider before delivery. `<resource>:<key>` uses the existing store
resolver and requires a declared dependency and an available source endpoint. `literal:<value>` is
rejected during declaration construction: literal secret material never enters the desired model,
deterministic id or manifest. Only the transient delivery envelope contains resolved bytes; the
protected repository stores the value and source together. An unresolved source is a named Rejected
result. Original source-only commands remain the gateway's declaration ledger.

`IssueCertificate` honors the supplied subject and SAN set. An existing certificate with different
identity is rejected until deleted; renewal preserves its identity. Private key and leaf storage
reuse the existing protected CA repository.

The control plane also accepts `cohesion.trust.add`, which the SDK manifest deliberately does not
advertise. It is the gateway-owned trust channel through IGatewayStoreClient, never a `Build`-declared
application command. Trust keeps owner `issuer@subject`, POST-only behavior, empty 204 success,
empty 409 conflict and existing 403 authorization refusals. `New` commands use owner `issuer`, accept
POST and DELETE, return 200 application/octet-stream on success, and JSON `{status,detail}`
refusals. The client accepts empty successful responses as Applied (Deleted for DELETE); legacy
`SendCommandAsync` continues to work. This owner split lets local gateway declarations authenticate
end to end.

Restricted trust grants accept `{trustKey,allowedCommandKinds}` while unrestricted grants retain the
bare JWK payload. The protected trust document round-trips the optional string array; absent or
empty means every command kind is allowed. Enroll(platformStore) is deferred to item 31t: automatic
Platform enrollment needs a gateway-owned mediator and Platform-audience signer.
