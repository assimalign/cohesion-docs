# SchedulerApplication

The `SchedulerApplication` type belongs to `Assimalign.Cohesion.Scheduler.Hosting`.

> **Status:** Implemented.

Namespace: `Assimalign.Cohesion.Scheduler.Hosting`

Assembly: `Assimalign.Cohesion.Scheduler.Hosting`

`SchedulerApplication.CreateBuilder`(args) creates the public concrete `SchedulerApplicationBuilder` and
discovers an enabled resource control-plane registration from the entry assembly. A null argument
array throws ArgumentNullException.

`Build` materializes caller services, validates schedule bindings, installs the http control-plane
service when an ambient endpoint exists, and adds the provider execution service. `RunAsync` owns the
full shared-host lifecycle.

## Concrete composition (T10 / O34)

`SchedulerApplication.CreateBuilder(args)` returns the public concrete `SchedulerApplicationBuilder`
; its `Build()` returns the public `SchedulerApplication : Host<SchedulerApplicationContext>`. The
public `SchedulerApplicationContext` implements `ISchedulerApplicationContext`, reading
`ContentRootPath` from the host environment. The application explicitly forwards the root lifecycle
contract to `IHost`, and consumers use the concrete application for `RunAsync` and `await using`.
Runtime options and supporting services remain internal.

Background-work registration belongs to the concrete `SchedulerApplicationBuilder`:
`AddService(IHostService)` and `AddService(Func<SchedulerApplicationContext, IHostService>)`. The
factory receives the same concrete context as Web's and `Database`'s `AddService`, so hosting consumers
can use environment, state, and hosted-service members beyond the small root contract. Factories run
once per build against the same context retained by the application; the hosted-service snapshot is
installed after factory evaluation. Services start in registration order and stop in reverse. No
area-owned service abstraction is introduced.
