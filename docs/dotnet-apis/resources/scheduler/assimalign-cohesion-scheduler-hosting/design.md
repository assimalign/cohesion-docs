# Assimalign.Cohesion.Scheduler.Hosting design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.Scheduler.Hosting`.

> **Status:** Implemented.

`SchedulerApplication` discovers an enabled resource registration from the entry assembly and builds
the public concrete `SchedulerApplication`. The builder materializes user host services, validates
every provider binding against the declared job registry, adds the resource control-plane listener
when an ambient http endpoint exists, and finally adds the schedule execution service.

The execution service snapshots schedules from every registered `IScheduleProvider` and runs their
evaluation loops concurrently. It does not execute unbound jobs. On stop it cancels trigger waits,
prevents new occurrences, and joins any occurrence already underway within the shared host shutdown
budget.

The private http listener serves public /healthz, /readyz, and /livez probes and their authenticated
/cohesion/v1 equivalents. It also serves authenticated endpoint and command discovery and accepts
/cohesion/v1/stop. Readiness stays unavailable until the outer Scheduler host reaches Started.

`SchedulerApplication.CreateBuilder(args)` returns the public concrete `SchedulerApplicationBuilder`
; its `Build()` returns the public `SchedulerApplication : Host<SchedulerApplicationContext>`. The
public `SchedulerApplicationContext` implements `ISchedulerApplicationContext`, reading
`ContentRootPath` from the host environment. The application explicitly forwards the root lifecycle
contract to `IHost`, and consumers use the concrete application for `RunAsync` and `await using`.
Runtime options and supporting services remain internal.

## HTTPS endpoint certificate contract (31t)

The enabled resource's `http` listener consumes the shared Hosting.Resources endpoint certificate
accessor. Endpoint metadata identifies an ordinary Secret mount (default `tls`), carrying one PEM
leaf/private-key/chain document; existing hand-authored IdentityHub and LogSpace bundles retain the
same format. Empty mounts are absent; malformed or multi-key bundles fail. TLS options are composed
in Hosting from the returned leaf and chain, with no hosting-isolation exemptions or dependency
changes. Plain application composition is unchanged.

## Optional telemetry (31b)

The registered resource constructor calls ResourceTelemetry.Configure using the invocation snapshot.
With no gateway or telemetry endpoint, existing providers and hosted services are unchanged. When
enabled, the shared Hosting.Telemetry sibling adds OTLP/HTTP JSON logging and a service registered
before producers; reverse `StopAsync` drains producers before a flush bounded by five seconds and the
host shutdown token. Logging remains composed only in Hosting. See
libraries/Hosting/`Assimalign.Cohesion.Hosting.Telemetry`/docs/DESIGN.md for ordering and protocol
limits.

## Concrete composition (T10 / O34)

Background-work registration belongs to the concrete `SchedulerApplicationBuilder`:
`AddService(IHostService)` and `AddService(Func<SchedulerApplicationContext, IHostService>)`. The
factory receives the same concrete context as Web's and `Database`'s `AddService`, so hosting consumers
can use environment, state, and hosted-service members beyond the small root contract. Factories run
once per build against the same context retained by the application; the hosted-service snapshot is
installed after factory evaluation. Services start in registration order and stop in reverse. No
area-owned service abstraction is introduced.
