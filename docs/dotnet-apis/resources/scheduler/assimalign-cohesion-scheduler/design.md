# Assimalign.Cohesion.Scheduler design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.Scheduler`.

> **Status:** Partial.

## Contract seam

`ISchedulerApplicationBuilder` owns two independent registries: declared jobs and schedule providers.
`AddJob` only declares work and is intentionally dormant. Cron and Timer builder verbs create their
internal `IScheduleProvider` implementations and bind an already-declared job. Hosting validates those
bindings during `Build` so a schedule cannot silently capture an undeclared job instance.

`ISchedulerApplicationContext` exposes immutable job and provider snapshots. Hosting depends on those
root contracts and never needs a feature-package reference.

## Occurrences and shutdown

`Schedule`<TContext> owns schedule identity, observable status, last and next occurrence timestamps,
per-provider enablement checks, and sequential execution of the jobs bound to one occurrence. A
provider cancellation token stops future waits and prevents another occurrence. Once a job begins,
its occurrence is drained without that scheduling token; the host shutdown grace bounds how long
`StopAsync` waits.

Provider implementations are internal to trigger packages. `IScheduleProvider` is the public behavior
seam for schedule discovery and per-schedule job enablement.

## Deferred behavior

Retries, misfire policies, durable history, leader election, and distributed worker ownership are
not implemented. The application model therefore enforces a singleton workload.

## AOT posture

Runtime composition uses explicit registrations and immutable snapshots. It does not scan for jobs
or activate them through reflection.

## Hosting-free application contract (O34)

The root contracts are hosting-free (O34): `ISchedulerApplication` exposes `Context`, `StartAsync`
, and `StopAsync`; `ISchedulerApplicationContext` exposes `ContentRootPath` plus the immutable
`Jobs` and `ScheduleProviders` snapshots. `ISchedulerApplicationBuilder` owns area declarations and
`Build()`. The root and feature packages reference no `Assimalign.Cohesion.Hosting*` library;
`COHRES004` enforces the boundary.

`SchedulerApplication.CreateBuilder(args)` returns the public concrete `SchedulerApplicationBuilder`
; its `Build()` returns the public `SchedulerApplication : Host<SchedulerApplicationContext>`. The
public `SchedulerApplicationContext` implements `ISchedulerApplicationContext`, reading
`ContentRootPath` from the host environment. The application explicitly forwards the root lifecycle
contract to `IHost`, and consumers use the concrete application for `RunAsync` and `await using`.
Runtime options and supporting services remain internal.

Background-work registration (`AddService`) is available only on the concrete Hosting builder.
