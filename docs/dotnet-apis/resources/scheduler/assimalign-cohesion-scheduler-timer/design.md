# Assimalign.Cohesion.Scheduler.Timer design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.Scheduler.Timer`.

> **Status:** Implemented.

`TimerSchedule`<TContext> waits for the configured due time, executes all enabled bound jobs
sequentially, then waits the fixed interval after completion. This fixed-delay behavior prevents
overlapping occurrences within one schedule.

Timer providers are internal and register through the root `ISchedulerApplicationBuilder` seam. A
positive interval is required. Trigger cancellation stops waits and future occurrences but does not
cancel work already running; outer host shutdown grace bounds the drain.

The package uses the hosting-free Scheduler contracts and has no shared Hosting dependency (O34).
