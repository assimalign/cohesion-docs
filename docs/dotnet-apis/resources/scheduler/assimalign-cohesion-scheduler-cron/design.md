# Assimalign.Cohesion.Scheduler.Cron design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.Scheduler.Cron`.

> **Status:** Partial.

`Crontab` accepts exactly five fields: minute, hour, day of month, month, and day of week. Each field
supports wildcard, list, inclusive range, and positive step forms. Values are normalized and
validated during parsing; malformed tokens, descending ranges, zero steps, and out-of-range values
fail deterministically.

`GetDateTime` uses an exclusive lower bound and returns a minute-precision occurrence. Sunday is
normalized from either 0 or 7. When both day fields are restricted they use OR semantics; when
either is wildcard the restricted field governs. Evaluation crosses month, year, and leap-year
boundaries and is bounded to one Gregorian cycle.

`CronSchedule`<TContext> evaluates against a TimeProvider, publishes the next occurrence, waits
cancellably, and executes bound jobs through its internal provider. Cancellation stops future
occurrences while an active occurrence drains.

The package references the hosting-free Scheduler root only; it has no shared Hosting dependency
(O34).
