# Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.WebSockets design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.WebSockets`.

> **Status:** Partial.

## Design intent

The package is the WebSocket **policy** of the Web pipeline, as the Http area's ADR 1 decided
(`cohesion/docs/libraries/Http/DECISIONS.md`, plan §7.4 decision 16).
[`Assimalign.Cohesion.Http.WebSockets`](../../../libraries/http/assimalign-cohesion-http-websockets/index.md)
owns the protocol: the handshake, its negotiation, and the BCL framing. A browser-facing server
needs more around that accept, and this package supplies it as one middleware, `UseWebSockets`:

1. **The cross-site WebSocket hijacking defense** (decision 6). A browser sends cookies with a
   WebSocket handshake to any site, and neither the same-origin policy nor CORS applies to it, so
   without a check any page a user visits could open a socket authenticated as that user. A
   handshake whose `Origin` is present and is neither the request's own origin nor an allowed one
   is refused with `403`. A handshake without `Origin` passes: browsers always send it, so its
   absence means the client is not a page.
2. **Defaults for every accept**: the keep-alive interval and timeout, and compression, which stays
   off unless enabled.
3. **The drain close** (decision 7). When the default server begins its lame-duck drain, every open
   socket is closed with `1001 Going Away`, so it ends cleanly within the stop's budget instead of
   being cut off without a close frame when the budget runs out.
4. **RFC 6455's refusals.** A malformed handshake gets `400`; one for another version gets `426`
   with `Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13`.

Unlike ASP.NET Core's `UseWebSockets`, the middleware is not what makes `context.WebSockets` work:
the protocol package does that on its own. The middleware adds the policy, and every accept
downstream of it takes the policy, whether or not it was written with the policy in mind.

The package also maps socket endpoints: `MapWebSocket` serves one handler for the HTTP/1.1 upgrade
and the HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 extended CONNECT, and applies the policy even when the middleware is
absent (see [Mapping a socket endpoint](#mapping-a-socket-endpoint)).

## The request flow

The middleware decides on the handshake status the protocol package computed, then on the origin.
In the diagram an arrow reads "goes to".

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Request["Request"] --> Status{"context.WebSockets.HandshakeStatus"}
    Status -->|"None: an ordinary request"| Next["next(context)"]
    Status -->|"Invalid"| Bad["400 Bad Request"]
    Status -->|"UnsupportedVersion"| Upgrade["426, Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13"]
    Status -->|"Valid"| Origin{"Origin absent, own origin, or allowed?"}
    Origin -->|"no"| Forbidden["403 Forbidden"]
    Origin -->|"yes"| Policy["install WebSocketPolicyFeature"]
    Policy --> Next
```

The refusals end the request; `next` does not run. A valid handshake continues with the policy
installed; an endpoint that never accepts it answers as it would any request, and the upgrade is
ignored (RFC 9110 §7.8).

## The origin check

The request's own origin is built from the **effective** scheme and host (`context.EffectiveScheme`,
`context.EffectiveHost`, the `Http.Forwarded` read convention), so behind a TLS-terminating proxy a
page at `https://app.example` matches a request the server sees as `http://10.0.0.5:8080` once
`UseForwardedHeaders` resolved it. Without that middleware the wire values are used, and the public
origin has to be listed in `AllowedOrigins`.

Every origin compared — the handshake's, the request's own, and each configured one — is reduced to
one serialized form, `scheme://host[:port]`: lower case, the scheme's default port dropped, an IPv6
address in canonical form. Two origins are the same when the forms are equal, ordinally. Same scheme
and host on another port is another origin.

| Handshake `Origin` | Result |
| --- | --- |
| absent (or empty) | allowed |
| the request's own origin | allowed |
| one of `AllowedOrigins` | allowed |
| anything else, including another port | `403` |
| `null` (a sandboxed page, a local file, a cross-origin redirect) | `403` |
| malformed, or several `Origin` fields | `403` |
| any, with `AllowAnyOrigin` set | allowed |

Configured origins are validated when `UseWebSockets` runs, and anything that is not an origin fails
there with a message that names the fix: a path (even a trailing `/`), a wildcard, `null`, user
information, or text that is not `scheme://host[:port]`. `null` cannot be allowed by value, because
every sandboxed page sends it; `AllowAnyOrigin` is the deliberate way to accept it.

**Why not reuse Web.Cors.** CORS governs which responses a page may read; it is not access control
and does not apply to WebSockets at all (see
[Web.Cors's non-goals](../assimalign-cohesion-web-cors/design.md#non-goals)). Its origin parser is
internal to Web.Cors, and a cross-feature reference for one parsing helper would couple the two
packages' release cadence. This package carries its own small parser with the same normalization
rules.

## Accept defaults

`WebSocketPolicyFeature` decorates the exchange's `IHttpWebSocketFeature`. It takes the inner
feature's name, so installing it replaces the inner feature in the exchange's features, and
`context.WebSockets` reads it; the handshake, the subprotocols and the single-shot accept stay the
inner feature's. Its `AcceptWebSocketAsync` fills every setting the accept leaves `null` from the
policy, on a copy (the caller's options are never modified), and forwards:

| Setting | Policy default | An accept overrides it with |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Keep-alive interval | `WebSocket.DefaultKeepAliveInterval`, 30 seconds | `HttpWebSocketAcceptOptions.KeepAliveInterval` |
| Keep-alive timeout | `Timeout.InfiniteTimeSpan` (unsolicited pongs, no timeout) | `KeepAliveTimeout` |
| Compression | off | `DangerousEnableCompression` |

30 seconds is under the 60-second idle timeout common to proxies and load balancers; ASP.NET Core's
two minutes is not. Compression is opt-in at both levels because it opens side channels (CRIME,
BREACH); the per-accept switch exists because whether a socket's messages mix secrets with
attacker-controlled data is a per-endpoint question.

## The drain close

The default server installs `IWebServerDrainFeature` on every exchange (see the
[Web root](../assimalign-cohesion-web/design.md#server-lifecycle-contract)); its token fires when
the stop begins, before anything is cancelled. When the feature is present, the accepted socket is
wrapped in `DrainAwareWebSocket`, which registers on the token and, when it fires, starts the close
handshake with `1001 Going Away`. The sequence shows a stop that drains a socket within its budget.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Host as Host stop
    participant Server as Default server
    participant Socket as DrainAwareWebSocket
    participant Client
    participant App as Endpoint
    Host->>Server: StopAsync(budget)
    Server->>Socket: Draining fires
    Socket->>Client: Close 1001 Going Away
    Client->>Socket: Close (echo)
    Socket-->>App: ReceiveAsync returns Close
    App->>Socket: CloseAsync (completes, nothing more to send)
    App-->>Server: endpoint returns, exchange ends
    Server-->>Host: drained within the budget
```

The wrapper exists because closing a socket behind the application's back breaks the application's
own close. Once the peer answers the drain's close, the BCL socket is `Closed`, and the `CloseAsync`
or `CloseOutputAsync` that ends a typical receive loop throws for an invalid state. So the close
output is claimed once, by whichever side asks first:

- **When the drain claimed it**, the application's `CloseOutputAsync` waits for the drain's close
  frame to be sent, and its `CloseAsync` also waits for the peer's answer if it has not arrived.
  Neither throws.
- **When the application claimed it first**, the drain does nothing.
- **A send after the drain's close** fails as a send on any closing socket does; a receive returns
  the peer's remaining messages and then its close.

The registration is released when the socket is disposed or aborted, and when the pipeline returns
(the exchange ends then, and with it the HTTP/1.1 connection or the HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 stream). A
socket accepted after the drain began is closed at once. A custom server that omits the drain
feature gets the BCL socket unwrapped, and its sockets end when it ends them.

The drain close runs on the thread that stops the server, inside the token's callback, so it only
starts the close frame's write. A peer that never answers the close is cut off when the budget runs
out, as any exchange is.

## Protocols

Nothing in the policy depends on the protocol. `Http.WebSockets` detects the handshake on each one
(the HTTP/1.1 upgrade, the HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 extended CONNECT) and reports one `HandshakeStatus`, so
the middleware's decisions are the same everywhere:

- **The origin check** reads the effective scheme and host, which an HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 request takes
  from `:scheme` and `:authority`.
- **The refusals** are `Http.WebSockets`' own, so an HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 `426` carries no `Upgrade` or
  `Connection` field, which those protocols prohibit.
- **The drain close** is a WebSocket close frame inside the socket, so it travels in the stream's
  `DATA` like any message. On HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 the server's drain also sends `GOAWAY`, which stops
  new streams and leaves the open socket's stream to finish its close handshake within the budget.

The end-to-end suites run the echo, the cross-site refusal, the `426` and the `1001` drain over all
three protocols: the BCL client over loopback TCP for HTTP/1.1 and prior-knowledge HTTP/2, and a
minimal HTTP/3 client over the in-memory multiplexed driver, since the BCL client has no HTTP/3
WebSockets.

Routing is the one thing that differs by protocol: the handshake's method is `GET` on HTTP/1.1 and
`CONNECT` on HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, so a WebSocket route mapped for `GET` only does not match the
latter. `MapWebSocket` removes the difference.

## Mapping a socket endpoint

`MapWebSocket(pattern, handler)` maps one route for both handshake methods, `GET` and `CONNECT`, on
the application (through the router `AddRouting` registered) or on a route group, and returns the
route's builder. #1336 exists because the `MapGet` alternative fails only in production: a local
test over `http://localhost` speaks HTTP/1.1 and passes, while every browser behind `UseHttps`
negotiates HTTP/2 through ALPN, opens the socket with RFC 8441, and gets the router's `405`. ASP.NET
Core documents the same pitfall; a verb that owns both methods removes it.

The diagram shows what the endpoint does with a request its route matched; an arrow reads "goes
to".

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Request["Request matching the route (GET or CONNECT)"] --> Status{"context.WebSockets.HandshakeStatus"}
    Status -->|"None: a plain GET or HEAD, a classic CONNECT"| Bad["400 Bad Request; the handler never runs"]
    Status -->|"handshake"| Guarded{"UseWebSockets ran?"}
    Guarded -->|"yes: its decorator is installed"| Accept["accept with the endpoint's options"]
    Guarded -->|"no"| Default["the default policy: 400/426, origin 403, then the decorator"]
    Default --> Accept
    Accept --> Handler["handler(context, socket); the socket is disposed when it returns"]
```

- **The handler receives the accepted socket**, `Func<IHttpContext, WebSocket, Task>`. Accepting is
  the endpoint's whole reason to exist, so the verb does it and the handler only drives the socket;
  the context is still there for route values, the user and `RequestCancelled`. An overload takes
  `Func<IHttpContext, HttpWebSocketAcceptOptions?>`, called after the handshake is validated and
  before the accept, so the accept options (a subprotocol among
  `context.WebSockets.RequestedProtocols`, compression, keep-alive) are chosen per handshake. A value
  it leaves `null` takes the policy's default, as for any accept.
- **The socket is disposed when the handler returns.** The handler completes the close handshake;
  one that returns early aborts the socket, and the exchange ends with it.
- **A request that is not a handshake gets `400`, never the handler.** The route exists, so `404`
  would hide it; the route does take `GET`, so `405` would contradict its own `Allow`. RFC 6455
  §4.2.1 answers a request that does not match the handshake with `400`, and so does every protocol
  here, where `426` could name the WebSocket protocol only on HTTP/1.1 (HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 prohibit
  `Upgrade`). A method other than `GET`, `HEAD` or `CONNECT` gets the router's `405` with
  `Allow: GET, CONNECT, HEAD`. A page and a socket therefore cannot share a URL through this verb;
  serve the page at another path, or write one handler that branches on
  `context.WebSockets.IsWebSocketRequest`.
- **The policy always applies.** When `UseWebSockets` ran, it refused a malformed or cross-site
  handshake before the endpoint and installed its decorator. Otherwise the endpoint applies the
  default policy itself, the one `UseWebSockets()` with default options applies, so an application
  that forgot the middleware still refuses a cross-site handshake. Configure origins, keep-alive or
  compression with `UseWebSockets`.
- **Policies attach where the endpoint is mapped.** The route builder takes metadata like any
  route's: `RequireAuthorization` on the endpoint or its group refuses an anonymous handshake with
  the scheme's `401` before the handler runs, on every protocol. A socket outlives any request
  timeout, so `DisableRequestTimeout()` belongs on socket endpoints under a timeout policy.
- **No source generator.** The verb takes typed delegates, not `Delegate`, so the Web endpoint
  generator neither intercepts it nor needs to; it is AOT-safe as written.

## Ordering

Register `UseWebSockets` after `UseForwardedHeaders`, whose effective scheme and host the origin
check reads, and ahead of every endpoint that accepts a socket. The area's
[middleware order](../../../../web/middleware-order.md) places it last, closest to the endpoints, so
host filtering, authorization and rate limiting apply to a handshake first.

A request-timeout policy (`Web.RequestTimeouts`) cancels a WebSocket endpoint when it fires, as it
does any request, so disable the timeout on WebSocket endpoints (`DisableRequestTimeout()`).

## Dependency rule

A Web feature library: it references the Web root (for `IWebApplicationPipelineBuilder` and
`IWebServerDrainFeature`), `Web.Routing` (the router builder and route groups `MapWebSocket` maps
into, a feature-to-feature reference the area allows), `Http`, `Http.WebSockets` and
`Http.Forwarded`, and nothing in the hosting family (`COHRES001`, `COHRES004`). The drain signal
crosses from `Web.Hosting` through the Web root's feature contract, which is how the policy reaches
the server's lifecycle without referencing it.

## AOT posture

No reflection and no runtime code generation: span parsing for origins, delegate composition for
the middleware and the endpoint, and a `WebSocket` subclass that forwards to the BCL socket. The Web
NativeAOT guard publishes the middleware and a `MapWebSocket` endpoint, and runs its echo over
HTTP/1.1 and over HTTP/2, its `400` for a plain `GET`, and a refused cross-site handshake.

## Non-goals

- **Per-endpoint origin policies.** One policy per pipeline, like ASP.NET Core's. An endpoint that
  needs more checks `Origin` itself before accepting.
- **A hub or message layer** (SignalR-style). A separate decision (Http ADR 1).
- **Message-size limits.** Recorded as "to revisit" in Http ADR 1.
