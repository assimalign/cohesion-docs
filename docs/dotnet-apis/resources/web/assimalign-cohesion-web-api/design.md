# Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Api design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Api`.

> **Status:** Partial.

## Design Intent

`Web.Api` is the endpoint-mapping surface over `Web.Routing`. It carries two families of `Map*`
overloads plus the compile-time and runtime support for AOT-safe typed-delegate parameter binding.
Binding is delivered by an interceptor-style Roslyn source generator
(`Assimalign.Cohesion.SourceGeneration.Web`) so the framework never reflects over handler signatures
or compiles expressions at run time — the standing NativeAOT requirement.

This package is the concrete, middleware-first delivery of the source-generated binding tracked by
issue #796. The originally-filed scope (result unions, `Web.Results`, `Web.Functions`,
`IEndpointFilter`) predates the 2026-07-10 middleware-first direction and does not apply: there are
no result types. A handler either writes the response imperatively (directly, or through
`Web.Serialization`'s `WriteContentAsync`), or returns a plain value that the generated thunk writes
for it (#1059, see "Return Values").

## Two Mapping Families

- **`WebApplicationMiddleware` overloads** (`Map(method, pattern, WebApplicationMiddleware)`,
  `MapGet(pattern, WebApplicationMiddleware)`) register a terminal endpoint verbatim. No binding
  happens; a handler whose only parameter is `IHttpContext` binds here by ordinary overload
  resolution (a specific delegate type beats `System.Delegate`).
- **`Delegate` overloads** (`Map`, `MapGet`, `MapPost`, `MapPut`, `MapPatch`, `MapDelete`) accept a
  typed handler: a lambda such as `(int id, IHttpContext context) => ...` or
  `(long id) => orders.Get(id)`, or a method group. Their bodies **throw** `NotSupportedException`:
  they are placeholders the generator rewrites. A handler the generator cannot rewrite is a `COHWEB`
  compile error (see "Compile-Time Diagnostics"), so reaching a placeholder at run time means only
  that the generator was not wired in (missing `CohesionAnalyzerReference` or
  `InterceptorsNamespaces` allow-list). Every call form reaches the generator (#1175):
  `app.MapGet(...)`, a conditional access `app?.MapGet(...)`, and the static form
  `WebApplicationPipelineBuilderExtensions.MapGet(app, ...)` (or
  `RouterGroupBuilderEndpointExtensions.MapGet(group, ...)`).

All `Map*` overloads compose on the router: they resolve the `IRouterFeature` and register a
`Route`, so an application still calls `builder.Services.AddRouting()` (builder) and `UseRouting()`
(pipeline) exactly as it does for the raw router surface.

**Every `Map*` returns the mapped route's `IRouterRouteBuilder` (#1055).** Per-endpoint policies
attach where the endpoint is mapped, for example
`app.MapGet("/orders/{id:int}", handler).WithName("order").RequireRateLimiting("api")`. Metadata
composes when the route table is built (Web.Routing design, "Endpoint convention builders"). Before
#1055 the verbs returned the pipeline builder, and a typed endpoint could carry no metadata at all.

**Fallback (#1056).** `app.MapFallback(middleware)` and `app.MapFallback(pattern, middleware)` map
Web.Routing's fallback route (lowest precedence, `GET`/`HEAD`, never a file-name path, never a 405).
For a single-page application use `MapFallbackToFile` in `Web.StaticFiles`.

**Groups hold typed endpoints.** `app.MapGroup(prefix)` returns the router's `IRouterGroupBuilder`.
`RouterGroupBuilderEndpointExtensions` gives it the same two families: the raw middleware overloads,
and the `Delegate` placeholders the generator intercepts.
`api.MapGet("orders/{id:int}", (int id) => ...)` therefore binds exactly like an application
endpoint, and the group's prefix, metadata and policies compose onto it.

## The Source Generator

`EndpointBindingGenerator` (an `IIncrementalGenerator` in `analyzers/`, netstandard2.0 — the
sanctioned non-AOT build component) intercepts each typed `Map*` call site with a C# interceptor
(`InterceptableLocation` / `[InterceptsLocation]`). The emitted interceptor:

1. Casts the `Delegate` back to the handler's exact delegate type (its inferred
   `Func<...>`/`Action<...>`) and invokes it directly — no reflection, no `Expression.Compile`.
2. Registers a generated `WebApplicationMiddleware` thunk through the raw `Map` overload.
3. Emits inline, AOT-safe binding for each parameter, then the failure short-circuits, then the
   direct handler call.
4. Writes the value the handler returned, if any (see "Return Values").
5. Attaches the endpoint's description — its request-bound parameters and its responses — to the
   route it maps (see "Endpoint Description Metadata").

The generator reads the call site through the compiler's operation tree, so a method group
(`app.MapGet("/orders/{id}", GetOrder)`) binds exactly like a lambda, and named arguments in any
order resolve. Before #1059 a method group was silently left to the throwing placeholder.

An endpoint module written over a type parameter binds like any other call site (#1174):
`static void MapOrders<TApp>(TApp app) where TApp : IWebApplicationPipelineBuilder, IWebApplication`
calling `app.MapGet(...)`, or a `TGroup : IRouterGroupBuilder` calling `group.MapGet(...)`. The
interceptor takes the receiver the intercepted method declares — generic over the application's
type when the call site's type cannot be named from generated code — so the application never fails
to compile on generated code it did not write.

Every binding key — the route, query, header and form reads, the `errors` key of a 400, and the
description name — reaches the emitted code as a C# string literal produced by
`SymbolDisplay.FormatLiteral` (#1172), so an attribute `Name` holding a `"` or `\` neither breaks the
build nor binds a different key than the one declared.

Interceptors are emitted into `Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Api.Generated`; consumers allow-list that
namespace with `<InterceptorsNamespaces>`. The generator is delivered two ways: in-repo/test
projects via `<CohesionAnalyzerReference Include="Assimalign.Cohesion.SourceGeneration.Web" />`,
and to Sdk.Web consumers via the `CohesionFrameworkAnalyzer` entry in the `App.Web` member list,
`resources/Web/Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Runtime/Directory.Build.props` (bundled under
`analyzers/dotnet/cs/` in `App.Web.Ref`). See the generator's own `docs/DESIGN.md` for emission
internals.

## Binding Sources and Inference

Each handler parameter is classified once, at compile time:

1. **Direct injections** take precedence: `IHttpContext` → the context; `IHttpRequest` →
   `context.Request`; `IHttpResponse` → `context.Response`; `CancellationToken` →
   `context.RequestCancelled`; any type implementing `IHttpFeature` → `context.Features.Get<T>()`.
   Before #1176 the request and response were classified as complex types and bound from the body,
   so a handler declaring them compiled and then failed every request with a 415 or a
   deserialization error.
2. **Uploaded files** (#1061) bind from the parsed `multipart/form-data` body by their type, with or
   without `[FromForm]` (whose `Name` sets the field name): an `IHttpFormFile` is the first file
   uploaded under its field name, required unless the parameter is nullable; `IHttpFormFile[]`,
   `IReadOnlyList<IHttpFormFile>`, `IReadOnlyCollection<IHttpFormFile>` and
   `IEnumerable<IHttpFormFile>` are every file uploaded under the name (RFC 7578 §4.3 sends a
   multiple-file field as several parts with one name), possibly none; `IHttpFormFileCollection` is
   every uploaded file, whatever its field name. Any other attribute on a file, and any other file
   shape (`List<IHttpFormFile>`, the concrete `HttpFormFile`), is COHWEB0003 rather than a JSON body.
3. **Explicit attributes** override the source: `[FromRoute]`, `[FromQuery]`, `[FromHeader]`,
   `[FromBody]`, `[FromForm]` (each with an optional `Name`, except `[FromBody]`).
4. **Convention** otherwise: a name matching a `{token}` in a literal route pattern → route; a
   scalar type (`string`, `IParsable<T>` primitives, enums, and their `Nullable<>` forms) → query; a
   complex type → body. **Route-or-query** replaces query for a scalar the call site cannot place
   (#1055). That happens in two cases: a route-group endpoint, whose group prefix is declared
   elsewhere (`MapGroup("api/{tenant}")` + `api.MapGet("orders", (string tenant) => ...)`), and a
   pattern that is not a string literal. The thunk reads the route value when the matched route
   captured one, and the query string otherwise.

Scalars convert inline with `IParsable<T>.TryParse(..., CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, ...)` (enums
via `Enum.TryParse<T>`), so no runtime binder or reflection is needed. Route values arrive as
`object?` (a boxed CLR value under a typed constraint such as `{id:int}`, or a string otherwise);
the thunk uses the boxed value directly when the runtime type matches and parses its invariant
string form otherwise. Non-nullable scalars are required; nullable/reference-nullable parameters are
optional. Bodies are read through `Web.Serialization`'s `ReadContentAsync<T>`; at most one body
parameter is allowed (COHWEB0004) and body binding is mutually exclusive with form fields and files
(COHWEB0005).

**The form is read once**, through `context.ReadFormAsync`, for every form field and file a handler
binds, so fields and files come from the same parse — the one `UseAntiforgery` or `UseForms`
already cached, when either ran. The read honors the Http.Forms limits (`HttpFormOptions`) of the
exchange's `IHttpFormFeature`: the defaults (a 128 MB multipart section, 4 MB values, 1,024
entries), or the limits an application sets by installing
`new HttpFormFeature(context.Request, options)` ahead of the endpoint. A form over a limit is
answered `413 Content Too Large` (RFC 9110 §15.5.14), recognized by the
`HttpFormLimitExceededException` the parse records as its `InvalidDataException`'s cause, not by its
message; any other unreadable form is a `400` (`errors` keyed `$form`). Before #1061 both reached the
exception boundary as a `500`. A body over the transport's own cap is answered `413` by the
transport, and an over-limit decompressed body by `Web.Compression`; the thunk does not catch
either. `UseForms()` parses every request eagerly, ahead of the endpoint, so a form it cannot read
never reaches the thunk: the middleware answers it with the same `413` or `400` payload and the
endpoint does not run (#1210, Web.Forms DESIGN).

## Return Values (#1059)

A typed handler may return a plain value. The thunk awaits it when the handler is asynchronous and
writes it as the response, so `app.MapGet("/orders/{id}", (long id) => orders.Get(id))` needs no
`IHttpContext`:

| Handler returns | The thunk |
| --- | --- |
| `void`, `Task`, `ValueTask` | Awaits the handler when it is asynchronous and writes nothing: the handler writes the response, as before |
| `string` (directly, or through `Task<string>`/`ValueTask<string>`) | Writes the text as UTF-8 under `Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8`, or under the `Content-Type` the handler set |
| Any other `T`, `Task<T>` or `ValueTask<T>` | Writes the value through `Web.Serialization`'s `WriteNegotiatedContentAsync<T>` |
| `null` (a reference type, or an empty `Nullable<T>`) | Writes no body and consults no serializer; the status becomes `204 No Content` unless the handler set another |

The thunk's path from binding to the written response:

1. **Bind the parameters.** A binding failure is answered `400` or `415` problem+json. A body read
   with no serialization registry, or with no contract for its type, throws
   `HttpContentSerializationException` to the exception boundary.
2. **Invoke the handler,** awaiting a `Task` or `ValueTask`.
3. **Write the result.** `void`, `Task` or `ValueTask`: the handler wrote the response. `null`: no
   body, and `204` unless the handler set a status. A `string`: UTF-8 text, `text/plain` unless the
   handler set a `Content-Type`. Any other value: `WriteNegotiatedContentAsync`, which writes the
   serialized body with `Vary: Accept` through an acceptable writer, answers a bodyless `406` with
   `Vary: Accept` when nothing is acceptable, and throws `HttpContentSerializationException` to the
   exception boundary when there is no registry or no contract.

The rules, and why:

- **No result types.** The non-goal stands: there is no `IResult` and no typed result union. A
  returned value is data, written one way. A handler that needs control of the response sets the
  status or headers on `IHttpContext` and either writes the body itself and returns `Task`, or
  returns the value and lets the thunk write it under the status it set.
- **Status 200 by default; a status the handler set wins.** The thunk never sets a status for a
  written value. The response starts at 200, so a value is a 200 unless the handler chose another
  code first: setting `context.Response.StatusCode = HttpStatusCode.Created` and returning the
  order answers 201 with the order as its body.
- **`null` is 204 No Content.** A null value is the absence of a representation. Serializing it
  would answer 200 with the body `null`, which a client cannot tell apart from a resource whose JSON
  is `null`; RFC 9110 §15.3.5 defines 204 for a response with no content to send. No serializer is
  consulted, so `null` needs no registry and no contract. When the handler already chose a status
  (404 for a missing resource) the thunk keeps it and writes no body; only the default 200 becomes
  204. A `Nullable<T>` that has a value is written as its underlying `T`, so the contract registered
  for `int` serves an `int?` handler.
- **`string` is text/plain.** Through the JSON writer, `"pong"` would be written as a JSON string,
  quotes included. The thunk writes the text as UTF-8 and sets `text/plain; charset=utf-8` unless the
  handler set a `Content-Type` of its own (a handler returning an HTML fragment sets `text/html`); a
  handler that names another charset takes responsibility for it, because the bytes are always
  UTF-8. Text needs no serialization registry, and it does not vary by `Accept`: RFC 9110 §12.5.1
  lets a server disregard `Accept` for a resource with one representation, so a string endpoint
  never answers 406.
- **Any other value is negotiated** (RFC 9110 §12, server-driven negotiation).
  `WriteNegotiatedContentAsync<T>` picks the registered writer for the request's `Accept` (q-value,
  specificity, then registration order, with the structured-suffix fallback in the Web.Serialization
  design), appends `Vary: Accept`, and serializes the value as the declared type `T`, not its runtime
  type. When nothing the registry offers is acceptable, the response is a bodyless
  `406 Not Acceptable`, which the status-code-pages middleware can explain. That is an outcome, not
  an exception.
- **No contract for `T` is a fault, not an outcome.** Under NativeAOT the JSON writer has no
  reflection fallback: it serializes only types the application's source-generated resolver covers
  (`AddJsonSerialization(AppJsonContext.Default)` with `[JsonSerializable(typeof(Order))]`). A
  returned type the negotiated writer has no contract for, or an application with no serialization
  registry at all, throws `HttpContentSerializationException`. The thunk does not catch it: like any
  handler exception it reaches the pipeline exception boundary (#881) and becomes a 500, because it
  is a composition error the developer fixes, not a request the client can correct. The built-in
  JSON writer resolves the contract before it touches the response, so the failed response carries
  no partial body and no `Content-Type`. The generator cannot check coverage at compile time,
  because the registered resolver is a run-time choice and may come from another assembly.
- **Streams are not values.** A handler that returns a `Stream` is a compile error (COHWEB0002):
  copy the stream to `context.Response.Body` and return `Task`. A `byte[]` is an ordinary value,
  serialized as base64 JSON, not a raw body. `Web.StaticFiles`' `SendFileAsync` and
  `WriteStreamAsync` response helpers (#1061) send a file or a stream from a handler with
  validators, preconditions and single ranges.

## Failure Semantics

Binding failures are outcomes the thunk writes imperatively as RFC 9457 `application/problem+json`
(via `Web.ProblemDetails`), never faults, and the handler does not run:

| Condition | Status | Payload |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unparseable/missing-required route, query, header, or form scalar | 400 | `errors` extension keyed by the parameter |
| A required `IHttpFormFile` is missing | 400 | `errors` extension keyed by the field name |
| The form exceeds an Http.Forms limit (`HttpFormLimitExceededException` as the parse's cause) | 413 | problem+json |
| The form is otherwise unreadable (a malformed multipart or urlencoded body) | 400 | `errors` extension keyed `$form` |
| The request carries no parseable Content-Type, or the registry has no reader for it (an empty registry included) | 415 | problem+json |
| `System.Text.Json.JsonException` while deserializing the body | 400 | `errors` extension keyed `$body` |
| `InvalidDataException` while reading the body: a malformed message framing, which the HTTP/1.1 transport also answers `400` (#1340) | 400 | `errors` extension keyed `$body` |
| The bound body model fails its registered validator (an application with `Web.Validation`, see "Validation") | 400 | `errors` extension keyed by member path |

Validation runs after every parameter is bound, so a binding failure is answered first.

Reading a body and writing a returned value draw the same line between the client's errors and the
server's (#1173). Both have outcomes the thunk answers and faults it never catches:

| Condition | Result |
| --- | --- |
| No registered writer satisfies the request's `Accept` | `406 Not Acceptable` with no body and `Vary: Accept`, an outcome the status-code-pages middleware can explain |
| No serialization registry is composed, and the endpoint reads a body or returns a negotiated value | `HttpContentSerializationException`, propagated as a fault |
| The reader for the request's Content-Type, or the negotiated writer, has no contract for the type | `HttpContentSerializationException`, propagated as a fault |

The thunk decides the 415 with the registry's non-throwing lookup (`GetReader`) before it reads, so
an `HttpContentSerializationException` from the read itself is never the client's doing: it means
the application registered no serialization at all, or its source-generated resolver does not cover
the parameter's type. Before #1173 the read path caught that exception and answered 415, which told
the client it had sent the wrong media type when the server was misconfigured. The distinction
needed no change in `Web.Serialization`: its lookup surface already separates "no reader for this
media type" (`GetReader` returns `null`) from "no contract for this type"
(`IHttpContentReader.CanRead` is `false`, and the read throws), per its faults-vs-outcomes model. An
empty registry stays a 415 because the registry then truthfully accepts no media type; a missing
registry is a composition error, as it is for a negotiated write.

Exceptions thrown by the **handler itself** are never caught — they propagate to the pipeline
exception boundary (#881), as do the serialization faults above.

## Compile-Time Diagnostics (#1059)

A typed call site the generator cannot rewrite is a compile error. Before #1059 the generator
skipped such a call site without a word, the call bound to the placeholder overload, and the
application threw `NotSupportedException` when it mapped the endpoint. Each `COHWEB` diagnostic is an
error, names the endpoint, says what is unsupported and what to write instead, and points at the
handler (a lambda's parameter list and arrow, or the method group) or at the offending lambda
parameter:

| ID | Reported when | What to write instead |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COHWEB0001 | The handler is a delegate instance (a `Func<...>` variable, a `Delegate`, a call that returns one, or an instance wrapped in `new Func<...>(instance)`), so its parameter names and attributes are not visible | A lambda or a method group |
| COHWEB0002 | The return type cannot be written: `async void`, a stream, an anonymous type, a ref struct, `dynamic`, a pointer, an awaitable other than `Task`/`ValueTask` (or an awaited value that is itself awaitable), a by-reference return, a generic type parameter, or a private, protected or file-local type | What the message names: `async Task`, copying the stream to the body, a named record |
| COHWEB0003 | A parameter cannot be bound: a complex type from `[FromRoute]`/`[FromQuery]`/`[FromHeader]`/`[FromForm]`, a `ref`/`out`/`in` modifier, a default value or a `params` array (both give the handler a compiler-generated delegate type), a ref struct, `dynamic`, a pointer, a generic type parameter, a type generated code cannot access, an uploaded file read from a source other than the form, or a file shape the binder does not produce (`List<IHttpFormFile>`, `HttpFormFile`) | What the message names: `[FromBody]`, a nullable parameter in place of a default value, `IHttpFormFile` or one of the file sequences |
| COHWEB0004 | More than one parameter binds from the request body | One body model; the other values from the route, query string or headers |
| COHWEB0005 | The handler binds a request body and form fields or uploaded files | Form fields and files only, or the model only |
| COHWEB0006 | The handler's delegate type cannot be named: more than 16 parameters, or an explicitly created delegate type that is private | A body model for the extra values; a lambda |
| COHWEB0007 | The endpoint reads a body or returns a negotiated value, but the compilation cannot name `Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Serialization` | A reference to the package; `Sdk.Web` applications receive it through `App.Web` |

A call site with a diagnostic gets no interceptor; every other call site in the compilation is still
rewritten. The rules live in the generator (`Internal/EndpointBindingDiagnostics.cs`) and are
release-tracked in its `AnalyzerReleases.*.md` files.

## Endpoint Description Metadata (#152)

The generator is the only component that knows a typed endpoint's parameter and result types at
compile time, so it records them on the route for documentation adapters that must not reflect — the
OpenAPI adapter (#152) first. Every typed endpoint it maps carries, as route-level metadata:

- **One `EndpointParameterMetadata` per request-bound parameter**, in handler order: the `Name` the
  request supplies it under (the route parameter, query key, header, form-field or file field name —
  an attribute's `Name` when one is given — and the handler parameter's name for a body or for the
  collection of every file), its `EndpointParameterSource` (`Route`, `RouteOrQuery`, `Query`,
  `Header`, `Form`, `Body`, `FormFile`), its declared CLR `Type`, and `IsRequired`, which matches the
  400 the thunk answers for a missing value (a body is always required). Injected parameters
  (`IHttpContext`, `IHttpRequest`, `IHttpResponse`, `CancellationToken`, features) are not request
  inputs and are not described.
- **`EndpointResponseMetadata` items**: a `200` whose `Type` is the written value's type (the `T` of
  `Task<T>`, `ValueTask<T>` or `Nullable<T>`, or `null` for a handler that writes its own response)
  and whose `ContentType` is `text/plain` for a string, or `null` when the serialization registry
  negotiates it; and a `204` with no type when the result may be `null`.

| Concern | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| Home | `Web.Api` (`src/Metadata/`, namespace `Assimalign.Cohesion.Web`), beside the `Map*` verbs that produce it. No OpenApi reference: the adapter maps these onto `OpenApiOperationMetadata` itself, so the dependency arrow stays OpenApi adapter → Web. |
| Shape | Sealed carriers with no interface, per the Web.Routing endpoint-metadata family rule. One carrier per concept: parameters and responses are read separately and compose separately. |
| Reading | `route.Metadata.GetOrderedMetadata<EndpointParameterMetadata>()` and `GetOrderedMetadata<EndpointResponseMetadata>()` on a built `IRouterRoute` — an adapter enumerates `IRouter.Routes` — or through `context.GetEndpointMetadata()` during a request. Responses are a set, so read them in order; a last-wins read returns whichever response was attached last. |
| Types | `typeof(...)` values the generator writes; nothing inspects members. An adapter produces a schema from the application's source-generated `JsonTypeInfo` for the type (System.Text.Json's `JsonSchemaExporter` over the resolver the application registered, which is NativeAOT-safe) and maps scalars such as `long` or `Guid` to primitive schemas. |
| `RouteOrQuery` | Described when the call site could not see the whole template (a group endpoint, a non-literal pattern). Resolve it against the built route's composed template, `IRouterRoute.Pattern`: a name the template contains is a path parameter, any other a query parameter. |
| The 204 | Listed when the compiler's nullability analysis says the result may be `null`: an annotated declared return (a method group's, or a lambda's explicit return type such as `Order? (long id) => ...`), a `Nullable<T>`, or — for an implicitly typed lambda, whose inferred return type is nullable-oblivious — a returned value whose null-state is maybe-null. Nullable-oblivious code lists no 204, though the thunk still answers 204 for a `null` at run time. |
| Not described | The outcomes the thunk produces on its own: 400, 413 and 415 binding problems and the negotiated 406. An adapter adds them by policy (a required parameter can produce 400, a form or file 413, a body 415, a negotiated response 406). |
| Extending | New sources are appended to `EndpointParameterSource`, never renumbered: `FormFile` (#1061) follows `Body`. A file parameter is described with its declared type — `IHttpFormFile` (required unless nullable), a file sequence, or `IHttpFormFileCollection` (named for the handler parameter, since it holds every file) — so an adapter maps it to a binary part of a `multipart/form-data` request body. An application describes further responses with `WithMetadata(new EndpointResponseMetadata(...))` on an endpoint or a group; they compose group items first, then the generated items, then the endpoint's own chain. |

#152 closed the one gap this left: an adapter needs the `JsonTypeInfo` the JSON writer serializes a
described type with, and `Web.Serialization` keeps the writer's options internal. `Web.Serialization`
now answers that question and no other, through
`IHttpContentSerializationFeature.TryGetJsonTypeInfo(type, out typeInfo)` (its design, "Contract
lookup"), so the description follows the wire's names and converters without the application
passing its context twice.

### Description verbs (#152)

The application curates the description with four convention verbs, shipped here as generic
`extension<TBuilder>(TBuilder builder) where TBuilder : IRouterConventionBuilder` members so they
work on a route and on a group alike, each attaching one sealed carrier from `src/Metadata/`:

| Verb | Carrier | Composition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `WithTags(params string[])` | `EndpointTagsMetadata` | Every item applies, outer group first; an adapter lists each name once |
| `WithSummary(string)` | `EndpointSummaryMetadata` | Last wins, so a route's replaces its group's |
| `WithDescription(string)` | `EndpointDescriptionMetadata` | Last wins |
| `ExcludeFromDescription()` | `ExcludeFromDescriptionMetadata` | Absolute: present anywhere, the endpoint is not described |

They are format-neutral documentation metadata, like the generated parameter and response
descriptions, and they live here for the same reason: `Web.Api` is a member of the `App.Web`
framework, so a library that maps endpoints can describe them without referencing the OpenAPI
adapter, which ships as its own NuGet package
([`Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.OpenApi`](../assimalign-cohesion-web-openapi/index.md)) together with the
whole OpenApi family. An application-declared `EndpointResponseMetadata` (`WithMetadata`) describes
further responses; the adapter treats any of these carriers as the application describing an
endpoint, which is what brings a raw middleware endpoint into the document.

## Antiforgery on form-bound endpoints (#1057)

A typed endpoint with a `[FromForm]` parameter or an uploaded-file parameter (#1061) requires
antiforgery validation — a file is form content a cross-site page can post as easily as a field: the
generator chains `AntiforgeryMetadata.Required` onto the route it maps, but only when the consuming
compilation references `Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Antiforgery` (every `Sdk.Web` application does,
through `App.Web`). `UseAntiforgery`, registered after `UseRouting`, validates the token and reads
the form for the form-token flow; the thunk then binds from that cached parse. Without
`UseAntiforgery` such an endpoint fails at dispatch rather than run unprotected;
`.DisableAntiforgery()` on the endpoint opts it out. The requirement is route-level metadata, so a
group-level opt-out does not reach it. `Web.Api` takes no reference to the package: the generator
names the type and emits nothing when it does not resolve.

## Validation — in `Web.Validation`, not here (#1060)

**History.** An opt-in per-endpoint validation seam (`IValidator`-carrying `Map*` overloads + an
`EndpointValidationMetadata` carrier threading an `Assimalign.Cohesion.ObjectValidation` validator
into the thunk) was implemented on the #796 branch and **removed before merge**: the owner descoped
request validation from this package on 2026-07-20, so `Web.Api` carries no `ObjectValidation`
dependency. The `ObjectValidation` AOT hardening done alongside it was kept. The owner then approved
#1060 in the HTTP/Web Phase 2 lineup, which brings validation back.

**Arrangement.** Validation lives in a separate feature package,
[`Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Validation`](../assimalign-cohesion-web-validation/index.md), and `Web.Api`
still references neither it nor ObjectValidation. Placing it there rather than in `Web.Api` is the
integrator's recommendation, pending owner review: it keeps the 2026-07-20 decision for this package
intact, and keeps the engine out of the closure of every endpoint-mapping consumer.

- **Registration** is the package's:
  `AddValidation(options => options.AddProfile(new CustomerProfile()))` keys a validator per model
  type by `typeof(T)`, with a global `Enabled` switch, and `DisableValidation()`/`RequireValidation()`
  turn it off or on per endpoint and per group (`ValidationMetadata`, most specific wins).
- **The call** is the generator's, and only when the application can name the package: like the
  antiforgery requirement, the generator resolves
  `Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Validation.HttpContextValidationExtensions` by metadata name and, when it
  resolves, emits a `ValidateAsync<T>` call for the bound request-body model after every parameter
  is bound and before the handler runs. Without the package nothing is emitted.
- **The failure** is a `400 application/problem+json` with an `errors` map, the shape binding
  failures use, keyed by member path (`Name`, `Address.City`).

Form models are not validated because they do not exist: `[FromForm]` binds scalars (see Non-Goals).
The package's design records the decision order, the key format and the AOT posture.

## Homing Rationale

Everything ships from `Web.Api` because the typed overloads are additional overloads of the same
`Map*` methods that already live here — splitting them into a new package would put two overloads
of `MapGet` in two packages. `Web.Api` gains a reference to `Web.ProblemDetails` (failure
rendering), already in the `App`/`App.Web` framework closure, so no manifest assembly was added. The
binding attributes live here rather than in the `Web` root, per the feature-contract packaging
discipline. `Web.Api` takes no reference to `Web.Serialization`: the generated code in the
application calls the body reader and the negotiated writer, and COHWEB0007 reports an application
that cannot name them.

## Non-Goals (v1)

- **Request validation in this package** — it lives in `Web.Validation` (see the section above).
- **Result types or typed result unions of any kind** — a returned value is plain data the thunk
  writes (see "Return Values"); a handler that needs control of the response writes it.
- **Filter/interceptor chains around handlers** — a natural follow-up seam, not built.
- **OpenAPI documents** — `Web.Api` describes typed endpoints in neutral metadata (see "Endpoint
  Description Metadata"); the OpenAPI adapter and document endpoint
  (`Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.OpenApi`, #152) build on it, and `Web.Api` takes no OpenApi dependency.
- **Content negotiation beyond `Web.Serialization`'s** — returned values use
  `WriteNegotiatedContentAsync`, which negotiates media types only (no `Accept-Charset` or
  `Accept-Language`).
- **Whole-object binding from form fields** — form binding is per-field scalar via `[FromForm]`,
  plus uploaded files.
- **Stream and file return values** — a handler writes a file or a stream itself, through the
  response helpers `Web.StaticFiles` ships (`SendFileAsync`, `WriteStreamAsync`, #1061), so
  `Web.Api` takes no file-system dependency.
- **Per-endpoint form limits** (`HttpFormOptions` as endpoint metadata) — the limits are the
  exchange's form feature's, set by installing one ahead of the endpoint.
