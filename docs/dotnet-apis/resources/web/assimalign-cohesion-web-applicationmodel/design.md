# Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.ApplicationModel design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.ApplicationModel`.

> **Status:** Partial.

## Intent

This project owns the Web resource area's typed orchestration model, portable planner, and default
control-plane factory. An enabled Web executable is a composition root: generated
`ResourceControlPlane.g.cs` references `WebResourceControlPlane.Create()` and registers the factory
against that executable's assembly through the `Assimalign.Cohesion.Hosting.Resources`
`ResourceRuntime` seam.

## Boundaries

- **The project references only** — `Assimalign.Cohesion.ApplicationModel` and
  `Assimalign.Cohesion.Hosting.Resources`.
- **It never references `Web.Hosting`,** — Web feature packages, or a platform package.
- **`Web.Hosting`** — discovers the assembly-keyed registration through the
  `Hosting.Resources` `ResourceRuntime`; it does not reference this project.
- **Each factory call returns** — a new control plane so in-process resources cannot share
  health contributors, endpoints, or lifecycle state.

## Manifest-backed resource and options

`WebResource` derives from `PlannedResource`; the base snapshots the supplied `ResourceManifest`
and projects its executable, endpoint, and mount compatibility surfaces. Artifact identity,
endpoints, probes, mounts, lifecycle constraints, settings, and references remain executable-owned
manifest facts.

`WebResourceOptions` derives from the shared `ResourceOptions`. `Replicas` is a deployer override
validated against the manifest's `maxReplicas` at application build. Public exposure remains a
build-produced manifest fact in the signed `cohesion/plan/v1` contract. The inherited storage slot
is not meaningful for this stateless kind, so a configured storage-size override is rejected rather
than ignored.

`AddWeb(manifest, options)` adds the typed resource and keeps plan computation deferred until
`IApplicationBuilder.Build()`.

## Web planner

`WebResource.CreatePlan(PlanContext)` is identified as `Web planner` in build diagnostics. It
requires `Kind = "Web"`, a `Deployment` workload, and no persistent `Volume` mounts. It inherits
the generic endpoint, probe, environment, and mount mapping, verifies that the result has no stable
identity or volume claims and exactly one ordinary service per endpoint, and preserves the generic
public-exposure mapping.

The result is `cohesion/plan/v1` IR only. Kubernetes Ingresses, load balancers, Docker port
publication, local bindings, and certificate resolution are owned by the selected platform compiler
and its gateway inputs. The Web planner neither references nor identifies a platform.

## Default control plane

The default Web plane aggregates `Hosting.Health` `IHealthContributor` instances, reports observed
endpoints, accepts graceful-stop requests, and advertises the Web command kinds. The command-kind
set is empty until the declarative-command work adds the area-specific handlers. `Web.Hosting`
serves health probes at `/healthz`, `/readyz`, and `/livez`, and management operations below
`/cohesion/v1` on the ambient `http` endpoint.

## AOT posture

Construction, planning, and registration are static. Golden plan serialization uses the
source-generated `ResourcePlanJsonContext`. There is no assembly scanning, reflection-based
activation, or runtime code generation.

## Typed descriptor seam

`AddWeb` returns `IWebResourceDescriptor`; `RemoteReferenceWeb(declaration, configure)` provides
that surface for a manifest-backed Web external. The internal wrapper delegates to the registered
graph descriptor and retains its exact resource identity. Typed `DependsOn` chaining retains the Web
descriptor type. The shared `IResourceCommandDescriptor` seam is available for future Web-owned
verbs, but this slice adds no Web command kind or mutation handler.

## Declared dependencies

| Reference | Kind |
|---|---|
| `Assimalign.Cohesion.ApplicationModel` | `CohesionProjectReference` |
| `Assimalign.Cohesion.Hosting.Resources` | `CohesionProjectReference` |
