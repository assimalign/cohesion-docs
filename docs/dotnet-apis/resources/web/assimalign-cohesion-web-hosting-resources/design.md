# Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Hosting.Resources design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Hosting.Resources`.

> **Status:** Partial.

The hosting-family integration extends `IWebApplicationPipelineBuilder` with
`UseResourceControlPlane(controlPlane, resourceContext, isApplicationReady, controlPlanePort = null)`
. Callers install it first on a private listener. It owns no port, host, service container, or
configuration provider. The readiness callback observes the owning resource host's
`HostState.Started`, not merely listener startup.

The route and envelope contract matches Web.Hosting's terminal: public `/healthz`, `/readyz`,
`/livez` aliases; namespaced health, readiness, liveness, endpoints, stop, and commands beneath
`/cohesion/v1`. Reads allow GET/HEAD, stop allows POST, and commands allow GET/HEAD/POST/DELETE.
Unknown namespaced routes are 404. Health reports preserve diagnostic values and ordinal
contribution/endpoint ordering. HEAD suppresses bodies.

Managed namespaced requests first consult the resource's registered `IResourceCredentialVerifier`
(`ResourceRuntime.TryGetCredentialVerifier(resourceContext)`, see the Hosting.Resources design),
passing the `Authorization` value split into scheme and credential. A `NoResult` verdict falls
through to the default application-key verification; any other verdict is final. The default
verifies an ES256 JWT with the published application P-256 JWK: issuer/application,
subject/gateway, key id, signature, required temporal claims and jti, and at most 24 hours from
issuance to expiry. It is a thin configuration of the shared `JsonWebTokenValidator`
(IdentityModel.Token.JsonWebToken) with `ResourceCredentialProfile` constants (Hosting.Resources);
the JWK parsing, signature, and claim rules are no longer copied here. Either path yields a
`ResourceCaller`, and the management plane admits only `Kind=Gateway` callers whose `Application`
is the ambient application and whose `Subject` is the ambient gateway — for application-key tokens
exactly the former `iss`/`sub` rule. Invalid credentials are 401 with a Bearer challenge; an
authentic credential for another resource audience, or a caller that is not this application's
gateway, is 403. A missing gateway identity enables standalone execution. The verifier is internal
and creates/disposes its cryptographic handle within each authenticated request; tokens rotated at
reconciliation are accepted without byte-equality pinning.

Command discovery includes both acceptedCommandKinds and applied commands. Non-object envelopes,
non-string/base64 payloads, and blank identity fields are 400. Unsupported kinds return 501 and
ownership/replay rejections return 409, both with status=Rejected and detail. This package declares
no command kinds or handlers.

O35 permits the exact Web.Hosting module to consume its own hosting family under `COHRES002`.
`COHRES001` still prevents roots and features from referencing it and prevents it from referencing
Web.Hosting. Web.Hosting and `Database.Hosting` consume this single terminal.
[Web.Server](../assimalign-cohesion-web-server/index.md)'s `IWebResponseCompletionFeature` defers
stop until the transport has written 202; custom servers without the feature retain direct stop.
The contract lived in the Web root until #1379 moved the server's per-exchange contracts to
Web.Server (owner decision 33); its namespace stayed `Assimalign.Cohesion.Web`, so this package
added a Web.Server reference and no code change. The executable regression compares the
Web.Hosting wrapper through FromProgram with the direct verb, guarding both composition paths.

`ResourceControlPlaneMiddleware` exposes `InvokeAsync` for manually composed hosts and `Validate` for
eager identity validation. `UseResourceControlPlane` calls `Validate` before registration. Its optional
trailing controlPlanePort gates every route, including bare probes; null means no gate. Web.Hosting
separately treats an unknown observed http/https port as disabled, so it forwards without invoking
this terminal. Web and `Database` validate managed identity at `Build` only when their control-plane
listener is installed.

Serialization uses Utf8JsonWriter and JsonDocument only. Dependencies are Web root, Web.Server,
Hosting.Resources, Hosting.Health, and `IdentityModel.Token.JsonWebToken`. App.Web exposes the
feature publicly; other areas consume its implementation privately. No ApplicationModel package
enters a framework.

Tests may reference Web.Hosting and the sample `Program`: `COHRES001`/002 skip the tests leaf via
`_CohesionHostingRuleApplies`; `COHAM001`/`COHRES003` skip harness path segments via
`_CohesionResourceBoundaryRulesApply` (`Build.Rules`.targets). These are separate gates, not
exemptions.

The certificate contract is consumed by each owning host when it constructs an HTTPS listener. This
middleware owns no TLS parser or listener and retains identical command and health behavior over
either transport.

Web and `Database` compose the same terminal through its root contracts; the integration never
references either runtime.
