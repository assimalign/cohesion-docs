# Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Forms design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Forms`.

> **Status:** Partial.

## Design intent

A single-purpose bridge that plugs HTTP form parsing (`Assimalign.Cohesion.Http.Forms`) into the Web
application middleware pipeline (`Assimalign.Cohesion.Web`). It owns exactly one thing: the
`UseForms()` pipeline-builder extension. All of the parsing intelligence — the streaming
urlencoded/multipart readers, the limits, the spill-to-disk buffering, the `IHttpFormFeature` seam —
lives in `Http.Forms`. This project is the resource-layer wiring, kept separate so that:

- **the protocol-layer form model** — stays reusable outside the Web host, and
- **a Web app opts** — into form parsing by adding this one package, without the
  Web runtime taking a hard dependency on a form model.

## What `UseForms()` does

`UseForms()` registers middleware that, per request:

1. Looks for an existing `IHttpFormFeature` in `context.Features`.
2. Installs a default `HttpFormFeature` over `context.Request` when none is
   present (so a middleware earlier in the pipeline can pre-install a custom
   feature and win).
3. Calls `ReadFormAsync(context.RequestCancelled)` to parse the body eagerly,
   then invokes the next middleware.

After it runs, downstream middleware reads `context.Request.Form` synchronously — the parse has
already happened and the result is cached on the feature.

## Eager vs. lazy — a deliberate, revisitable choice

`UseForms()` parses **every** request that flows through it, regardless of Content-Type. Non-form
bodies (`application/json`, no body, etc.) yield an empty collection cheaply because the feature
short-circuits on an unrecognized media type without draining the stream. The trade-off is that a
request whose form is never read still pays a small detection cost.

This is intentional for the common "forms app" shape where handlers expect `request.Form` to be
populated. Apps that only need forms on specific routes should skip `UseForms()` and call
`context.ReadFormAsync(...)` lazily inside those handlers instead. A future `UseForms(options)`
overload could add a content-type predicate or a lazy mode; that is a additive API change, not a
redesign, and is deliberately not built until a consumer needs it.

## Boundaries

- **No parsing logic here.** If a form-parsing behavior needs changing, it
  changes in `Http.Forms`, not in this middleware.
- **No DI/logging/config coupling.** The middleware reads and mutates only the
  `IHttpContext` feature collection; it does not resolve services at request
  time. Extensibility is via installing a different `IHttpFormFeature`, not
  service location.

## Non-goals

- **A model binder (form → typed object)** — that belongs to the Web API /
  source-generation layer.
- **Per-route form configuration** — deferred until a real need appears (see the
  eager/lazy note above).
