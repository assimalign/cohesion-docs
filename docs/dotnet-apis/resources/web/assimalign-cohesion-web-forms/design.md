# Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Forms design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Forms`.

> **Status:** Partial.

## Design intent

A single-purpose bridge that plugs HTTP form parsing (`Assimalign.Cohesion.Http.Forms`) into the Web
application middleware pipeline (`Assimalign.Cohesion.Web`). It owns exactly one thing: the
`UseForms()` pipeline-builder extension. All of the parsing intelligence — the streaming
urlencoded/multipart readers, the limits, the spill-to-disk buffering, the `IHttpFormFeature` seam —
lives in `Http.Forms`. This project is the resource-layer wiring, kept separate so that:

- **the protocol-layer form model** — stays reusable outside the Web host, and
- **a Web app opts** — into form parsing by adding this one package, without the
  Web runtime taking a hard dependency on a form model.

## What `UseForms()` does

`UseForms()` registers the internal `FormsMiddleware`, which, per request:

1. Looks for an existing `IHttpFormFeature` in `context.Features`.
2. Installs a default `HttpFormFeature` over `context.Request` when none is
   present (so a middleware earlier in the pipeline can pre-install a custom
   feature and win).
3. Calls `ReadFormAsync(context.RequestCancelled)` to parse the body eagerly.
4. Answers a form the parse rejects and stops there (next section), or
   otherwise invokes the next middleware.

After it runs, downstream middleware reads `context.Request.Form` synchronously — the parse has
already happened and the result is cached on the feature.

## An unreadable form is the client's error (#1210)

The parse runs ahead of every route, so a form it rejects must not become a fault. Before #1210 the
`InvalidDataException` escaped the middleware: any client could post an oversized or malformed form
to any route and get a `500`, with an Error-level fault log at the exception boundary. The middleware
now answers it and the rest of the pipeline does not run:

| The parse throws | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| `InvalidDataException` whose `InnerException` is `HttpFormLimitExceededException` (a body over a configured `HttpFormOptions` limit) | `413 Content Too Large` (RFC 9110 §15.5.14), `application/problem+json`, detail "The request form exceeds a configured size limit." |
| Any other `InvalidDataException` (a malformed body) | `400 Bad Request`, `application/problem+json`, detail "One or more binding errors occurred." and `errors` keyed `$form` |
| Anything else | Not caught (below) |

- **The same payload as a form-bound endpoint.** Both answers are byte for byte what the
  endpoint-binding generator's form read writes for the same failure, so a client gets one answer
  whether `UseForms()` or the endpoint parsed the form. The limit is told apart from a malformed body
  by the cause's type, not by the message (Http.Forms DESIGN).
- **The limits are the feature's.** The defaults apply to the feature this middleware installs. An
  application that installs `new HttpFormFeature(context.Request, options)` ahead of `UseForms()` gets
  its own limits answered `413` the same way.
- **A committed head aborts instead.** The parse runs before `next`, so the head is normally still
  writable. When a middleware ahead of this one has already committed it
  (`IHttpResponseStreamingFeature.HasStarted`), the status can no longer be set and a problem body
  would land inside another response, so the middleware cancels the exchange instead, as
  `UseAntiforgery` does.
- **What is not caught.** A body over the transport's own cap, an over-limit decompressed body
  (`Web.Compression`), an `IOException` from a broken connection and a cancelled request belong to
  their owners, exactly as they do for a form-bound endpoint.
- **An empty file input is not an error.** A browser sends an optional `<input type="file">` left
  empty as a part with `filename=""` and no content. Http.Forms reads it as an empty value rather
  than a file, so the request reaches the next middleware with nothing in `Form.Files`. That rule
  lives in the parse (Http.Forms DESIGN), so a form-bound endpoint and `UseAntiforgery` read the same
  form the same way.

The failed parse stays cached on the feature, so nothing downstream could read the form anyway:
answering here is the only place the request can still get a client-error status.

## Eager vs. lazy — a deliberate, revisitable choice

`UseForms()` parses **every** request that flows through it, regardless of Content-Type. Non-form
bodies (`application/json`, no body, etc.) yield an empty collection cheaply because the feature
short-circuits on an unrecognized media type without draining the stream. The trade-off is that a
request whose form is never read still pays a small detection cost.

This is intentional for the common "forms app" shape where handlers expect `request.Form` to be
populated. Apps that only need forms on specific routes should skip `UseForms()` and call
`context.ReadFormAsync(...)` lazily inside those handlers instead. A future `UseForms(options)`
overload could add a content-type predicate or a lazy mode; that is a additive API change, not a
redesign, and is deliberately not built until a consumer needs it.

## Boundaries

- **No parsing logic here.** If a form-parsing behavior needs changing, it
  changes in `Http.Forms`, not in this middleware.
- **No DI/logging/config coupling.** The middleware reads and mutates the
  `IHttpContext` feature collection, and writes the response only to reject an
  unreadable form; it does not resolve services at request time. Extensibility
  is via installing a different `IHttpFormFeature`, not service location.
- **References.** The Web root and `Http.Forms`, plus `Web.ProblemDetails` for
  the rejection payload (feature to feature, which the Web dependency rule
  allows) and `Http.Streaming` for the committed-head check. All four are
  already App.Web members, and none is a `Hosting*` library.

## Non-goals

- **A model binder (form → typed object)** — that belongs to the Web API /
  source-generation layer.
- **Per-route form configuration** — deferred until a real need appears (see the
  eager/lazy note above).
- **Antiforgery validation** — that is `Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Antiforgery`
  (#1057). It also protects header-token requests that carry no form, so it is
  not a form concern. For the form-token flow it reads the form through the same
  `IHttpFormFeature` parse cache, so `UseForms()` ahead of it costs no second
  parse.
