# Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Hosting design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Hosting`.

> **Status:** Partial.

`Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Hosting` is the composition root for the Web resource: it builds a
`WebApplication` (a `Host<WebApplicationContext>`), wires the middleware pipeline, and owns the
runtime server that turns accepted HTTP connections into pipeline invocations. It is the **only**
Web layer where DI, logging, and configuration are integrated, and that integration is strictly
builder-time — nothing resolves services per request.

**The hosting module is dependency-isolated within the Web area** (rule adopted 2026-07-10, recorded
in `resources/Web/README.md`): no Web feature library references this package — a feature that did
would drag the DI/configuration composition surface into every consumer — and this package
references **no** Web feature library. It references the root `Assimalign.Cohesion.Web`
abstractions, its own hosting family under O35, and non-Web infrastructure. Applications still see
the whole Web family because the `App.Web` shared framework (via `Sdk.Web`) delivers every Web
assembly; builder verbs ship with their features (`AddAuthentication` moved to `Web.Authentication`
, `AddCookie` /`AddJwtBearer` to their handler packages) and compose against the root
`IWebApplicationBuilder` seam. The one sanctioned exception is `Web.Testing`, the harness that
drives this concrete runtime.

This document focuses on the piece with the most load-bearing runtime behaviour:
`WebApplicationServer`, the default `IWebApplicationServer`. Its dispatch model and stop semantics
are the contract the rest of the Web middleware stack builds on, so they are recorded here rather
than left to be re-derived from the code.

The Web runtime references the public response-completion contract and the shared terminal; the
terminal depends only on the Web root within this area.

## Design intent

The server has one job: pull connections off a listener and drive each one through the middleware
pipeline, forever, without letting any single connection — well-behaved or hostile — degrade the
others or take down the host.

Three properties fall out of that intent and shape the whole implementation:

- **Connections are independent.** One connection's pace, idleness, or failure
  must never be observable by another. This rules out any design that serves
  connections from a shared loop.
- **`Application` faults are contained.** Middleware is arbitrary user code. A
  throw from it is expected, not exceptional, and must cost exactly one
  connection — never the accept loop, never the process.
- **Shutdown is deterministic.** Stopping the server drains what is in flight and
  releases every resource, without leaving an unobserved exception behind.

## `Application` lifecycle composition

The concrete `WebApplicationBuilder.AddService` verb registers application lifecycle services
independently of server registration. At `Build`, `WebApplicationBuilder` invokes each deferred
service factory exactly once against the final `WebApplicationContext` and freezes the resulting
services in registration order. `WebApplicationContext.HostedServices` enumerates that snapshot
before the DI-owned server-service registrations, including the constructor-reserved default-server
slot.

The Web host rejects concurrent service start or stop, so this two-phase enumeration is the
lifecycle guarantee: every application service starts before any Web server, services preserve their
own registration order, and reverse host shutdown drains every server before stopping application
services. Keeping the application-service snapshot outside the server's DI registry is intentional;
otherwise the default server, registered when the concrete builder is constructed, would precede
later `AddService` calls and violate the public contract.

## Server dispatch model

```text
StartAsync ──> await listener.BindAsync ──> AcceptLoopAsync (one stored Task)
                                             │  (optional) await a concurrency slot
                                             ├─ await listener.AcceptOrListenAsync
                                             └─ dispatch ─> ServeConnectionAsync (one tracked Task per connection)
                                                               await using connection
                                                                 OpenAsync
                                                                 await foreach ReceiveAsync
                                                                   pipeline.ExecuteAsync ─> SendAsync ─> dispose exchange
                                                                 dispose context
                                                               (connection disposed by await using)
```

**`Bind` before Started.** `StartAsync` first awaits the aggregate HTTP listener's `BindAsync`. Only
after every transport endpoint is bound does it schedule the stored accept-loop task and return. A
bind failure is surfaced as `HostStartupException`, preserving the transport exception as its inner
exception; the `ResourceHost` from `Hosting.Resources` can therefore classify typed
configuration/dependency causes as exit 64/69 and other pre-ready bind failures as exit 70. The
default server is registered as both `IWebApplicationServer` and `IHostService`, resolving to the
same singleton, so the host lifecycle actually drives this boundary. When an application registers
only a custom server and supplies no default-listener configuration, the reserved default
host-service slot is inert; it does not start an empty aggregate alongside the custom server.

The root `IWebApplicationBuilder.AddServer` overloads accept servers that know nothing about
Hosting. `Web.Hosting` registers one internal `IHostService` adapter per server; the adapter
delegates start/stop while `WebApplicationContext.Servers` unwraps it back to the original Web
contract object. The adapter is registered only as a host service, so it cannot replace the default
server's `IWebApplicationServer` singleton. Consequently a configured default and a custom server
each start exactly once, in registration order, and stop in reverse order. The factory overload is a
singleton registration and receives the final application context.

**One accept loop, one task per connection.** The loop accepts a connection and *hands it off* to
`ServeConnectionAsync` on its own `Task`, then loops straight back to accept the next one. The loop
never awaits a connection's service.

**Why this is the whole point.** The previous implementation queued one `async void` thread-pool
work item that accepted a connection and then `await foreach` -ed its entire receive sequence inline
before accepting the next. A single idle HTTP/1.1 keep-alive client — parked in `ReceiveAsync`
waiting for a request it never sends — blocked that loop indefinitely, so every other accepted
connection sat unserved in the listener backlog. Per-connection dispatch removes the shared
bottleneck: the idle client parks on *its* task while every other task runs.

**Stored `Task`, never `async void`.** The accept loop and each connection task are stored/tracked
`Task` s. An `async void` body escalates any escaped exception to a process-terminating unhandled
exception via the thread pool; a `Task` makes the exception observable instead. The accept loop
additionally swallows its own terminal faults so the stored task always completes cleanly.

**In-flight tracking.** Connection tasks are registered in a `ConcurrentDictionary<long, Task>`
keyed by a monotonic id, added by the accept loop and removed by each task as it completes. The map
is the drain set `StopAsync` awaits. A connection that completes synchronously (only possible with a
degenerate/empty receive sequence) is removed immediately after registration so the map never leaks
a completed entry.

## Layering boundary — what the server does *not* do

Wire-level failure isolation lives one layer down, in `Assimalign.Cohesion.Http.Connections` (see
its `docs/DESIGN.md`, "Receive-loop failure isolation"). Truncated frames, malformed request lines,
peer resets, HTTP/2 `RST_STREAM` /`GOAWAY`, and per-stream HTTP/3 faults are all classified and
handled there: the receive enumerable simply stops yielding on a wire error and the surrounding
`await using` disposes the connection.

The server therefore owns **only** the concerns above that layer:

| Concern | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| Wire-protocol conformance, frame parsing, per-stream reset | `Http.Connections` |
| Wire-level failure isolation (bad frames, peer reset) | `Http.Connections` |
| `Application`-exception isolation (middleware throws) | **this server** |
| Per-connection dispatch / concurrency | **this server** |
| Connection + context disposal | **this server** |
| In-flight tracking + graceful drain | **this server** |
| Optional concurrency cap | **this server** |

The server never inspects a frame, a stream id, or a protocol version. It sees `IHttpConnection` →
`IHttpConnectionContext` → `IHttpContext` and nothing lower.

## Error model — application-exception isolation

Each connection's receive loop wraps pipeline execution in a boundary that catches exceptions by
scope:

- **`OperationCanceledException`** — cooperative shutdown or a per-exchange
  cancellation. Treated as a clean drain, not a fault: the loop unwinds quietly.
- **Any other `Exception`** — an application fault from the middleware pipeline
  (or the per-exchange receive/send). The connection is `Abort`-ed so the peer
  sees it torn down, and the enclosing `await using` disposes it. The accept loop
  is untouched and keeps serving; a subsequently accepted connection is served
  normally.

Catching bare `Exception` here is a deliberate, documented departure from the "catch specific
exceptions" rule. This is a **fault-isolation boundary around arbitrary user code**, the same
pattern the transport's accept loop uses (`HttpConnectionListener.RunStreamAcceptLoopAsync`). The
alternative — letting an unknown middleware exception propagate out of a background task — is
precisely the process-crash hazard this component exists to remove. The catch is annotated in source
so future readers do not "correct" it back to a narrow catch.

## Disposal contract

When a connection's loop ends — normally, by client disconnect, or by pipeline fault — the server
disposes, in order:

1. **Each exchange** (`IHttpContext`) in a `finally` around its pipeline
   execute/send, so an exchange is released even if the pipeline throws.
2. **The connection context** (`IHttpConnectionContext`) in a `finally` after the
   receive loop.
3. **The connection** (`IHttpConnection`) via `await using`.

`IHttpConnectionContext` is intentionally *not* `IAsyncDisposable`: a context is a projection over
the connection, and the connection releases the underlying transport on its own disposal (see
`Http1Connection.DisposeAsync`). The server still disposes any context that *does* implement
`IAsyncDisposable` /`IDisposable` through a type test (no reflection), so a future stateful context
is torn down deterministically. Today this is a defensive no-op for the real projection contexts; it
exists so the disposal guarantee holds regardless of a context's internal state.

## Stop semantics

`StopAsync` performs a graceful, idempotent shutdown:

1. **Signal shutdown.** `Cancel` the single shutdown `CancellationTokenSource`. This
   both stops the accept loop and unblocks every in-flight connection — an idle
   keep-alive parked in `ReceiveAsync` observes the cancellation and unwinds, so
   the drain cannot hang on it.
2. **Wait for the accept loop.** Await the accept-loop task first, so no new
   connection task can be added after the in-flight set is snapshotted.
3. **Drain in-flight connections.** `await Task.WhenAll` over the tracked
   connection tasks. Each task is self-contained — it swallows its own
   cancellation and faults and never rethrows — so the drain completes without
   surfacing an unobserved `OperationCanceledException` or any other escaped
   exception.
4. **`Dispose` the listener**, then the shutdown token source and (if present) the
   concurrency semaphore. Listener disposal runs from a `finally`, including when
   the caller's drain token expires, so `StopAsync` never completes with the port
   still owned by this server.

Cancelling before starting, or stopping twice, is safe and idempotent. The drain budget is owned by
the caller's host lifecycle (`Host<TContext>.StopAsync` applies `ShutdownTimeout`); the server
honors that token while awaiting its loops but still performs listener release.

**Cancellation is drain, not force-kill of in-progress requests.** A single token governs both "stop
accepting" and "unblock in-flight connections." Idle keep-alives unblock immediately; a request
actively executing in the pipeline observes the same cancellation and unwinds. Letting an
in-progress request run to completion before closing its connection (lame-duck draining) is a
deliberate non-goal for this iteration — see below.

## Concurrency cap (`MaxConcurrentConnections`)

Optional, configured builder-time via `WebApplicationServerBuilder.LimitConcurrentConnections(int)`
and carried on `WebApplicationServerOptions.MaxConcurrentConnections`. `null` (the default) means
**unlimited**.

When set to a positive `N`, a `SemaphoreSlim(N, N)` gates the accept loop: a slot is acquired
**before** accepting a connection and released when that connection's task finishes. Once `N`
connections are being served, the loop stops accepting, so additional connections stay in the
listener's backlog channel — accepted by the transport but not opened or served — applying natural
backpressure until an active connection completes. A non-positive cap is rejected at construction.

The gate is chosen for AOT-safety: a semaphore, stored `Task` s, and a `ConcurrentDictionary` — no
reflection, no dynamic code.

## AOT posture

`IsAotCompatible=true` holds with no special handling. The dispatch machinery is `SemaphoreSlim`,
`CancellationTokenSource`, `ConcurrentDictionary`, `Interlocked`, `Task`, and `await using`
/`await foreach` — all trim/AOT-clean. The defensive context disposal is a `switch` type test, not a
reflection probe. No runtime code generation, no `Assembly.LoadFrom`, no reflection-based
serialization.

## `Application` feature seeding

`IWebApplicationBuilder.AddFeature` registers `IHttpFeature` singletons (routing's per-application
`IRouterFeature` is the canonical example), but a feature is only useful once it is present on each
exchange's `IHttpContext.Features` collection. That bridging happens when the pipeline is built:
`WebApplication` 's pipeline `Build()` resolves the registered features **once** and, when any
exist, wraps the composed pipeline in a seeding middleware that stamps each feature onto every
exchange before any user middleware runs.

Two deliberate properties:

- **Builder-time snapshot, not request-time service location.** The feature set is
  materialized at pipeline build (which happens when the server is resolved). Per
  the hosting philosophy, nothing resolves services per request — the per-exchange
  work is a plain array walk. Features registered after the pipeline is built are
  not observed, the same snapshot rule the middleware list follows.
- **`Application`-registered features are per-application.** Each application seeds
  only its own DI-registered features, which is half of the process-wide isolation
  story (#789's per-application router state is the other half).

## The pipeline terminal — bodyless 404 fallback (#881)

`WebApplication` 's pipeline `Build()` composes the innermost middleware — the terminal reached only
when every registered middleware chained to `next` and none produced a response. It used to be a
silent `Task.CompletedTask`, which handed the transport an empty `200` for any unhandled request.
It now sets a **bodyless `404 Not Found` ** when the response arrives untouched (still `200`, no
body, no `Content-Type`, no `Location`); a response a middleware already shaped — a non-`200`
status, a written body/content type, or a redirect `Location` — is left as-is.

Two deliberate properties:

- **Payload-free by necessity.** The resource hosting-isolation rule (`COHRES002`)
  forbids this runtime module from referencing the Web feature libraries, including
  `Web.ProblemDetails`, so the terminal can only *set the status*. Turning the
  bodyless 404 into an RFC 9457 problem+json body is the job of the opt-in
  `UseStatusCodePages()` middleware in `Web.ErrorHandling`, which the application
  composes over the top.
- **A deliberate empty `200` must be terminal.** A `200` with no body is
  indistinguishable from an untouched response, so a middleware that means to answer
  with an empty `200` must be terminal (not call `next`); a bodyless-`200`
  fall-through is read as unhandled. This is the accepted trade-off for turning
  no-match into a `404` without a routing-level "handled" signal.

## Testing

Behaviour is verified in `tests/` with xUnit + Shouldly against instrumented doubles
(`FakeHttpConnectionListener`, `FakeHttpConnection`, `FakeHttpConnectionContext`,
`FakeHttpContext`, `FakePipeline`) that let a test script receive sequences, park connections,
throw from the pipeline, and observe opens/sends/aborts/disposals. The suite pins each acceptance
property: idle keep-alive non-starvation, single-connection fault isolation with continued service,
connection+context disposal on every exit path, graceful `StopAsync` drain + listener disposal, and
the concurrency cap holding connections back until a slot frees.

The same properties are additionally pinned **end to end** by the full-pipeline integration suite
(`WebApplicationPipelineIntegrationTests`, `WebApplicationServerIntegrationTests`, and
`WebApplicationTerminalFallbackTests` for the bodyless-404 terminal), which drives the real server
over the in-memory transport through `Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Testing` 's
`WebApplicationTestFactory` — a real `HttpClient`, real HTTP/1.1 exchanges, no sockets. It covers
middleware onion ordering and short-circuiting, per-connection dispatch (a parked connection does
not starve others), application-fault isolation with continued service, the unhandled- request 404
fallback, and graceful shutdown draining (in-flight unwind, idle keep-alive unblock, post-stop
connection refusal).

## Non-goals

- **Lame-duck request draining.** Waiting for in-progress exchanges to finish
  before cancelling on shutdown (versus cancelling them with the drain token) is
  future work; it needs a two-phase signal ("finish the current exchange, accept
  no new ones on this connection") that this iteration does not implement.
- **Per-request service resolution.** DI/logging/config are builder-time only;
  the server resolves nothing per connection or per request.
- **Re-implementing wire behaviour.** Protocol conformance and wire-level failure
  isolation stay in `Http.Connections` and are never duplicated here.
- **Host filtering.** Allowed-hosts enforcement ships as the
  `Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.HostFiltering` feature package (`UseHostFiltering`,
  registered first by the application). The runtime module deliberately has no
  knowledge of it — the hosting-isolation rule forbids the reference, and
  pipeline composition is the application's, not the host's.
The Web resource's composition root: the `WebApplicationBuilder` / `WebApplication` surface that
wires the `Assimalign.Cohesion.Http.Connections` transport, the request pipeline, DI, logging, and
configuration into a runnable host. Per the repo's hosting philosophy, **this is the one place DI /
Logging / Config integration happens** — the transport and protocol libraries stay free of those
concerns.

This document grows as areas are touched rather than re-documenting the whole surface at once. The
broader server/runtime shape (per-connection dispatch, error isolation, graceful stop) is being
reworked under issue #762; this file currently captures only the design decisions that are settled.

## Enabled-resource control plane

`WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args)` uses the process entry assembly for standalone execution and
honors its generated `Hosting.Resources` `ResourceRuntime` registration. During an in-process
resource invocation, the ambient invocation's logical member assembly takes precedence; no
caller-stack reflection is required. When enabled, the builder binds the ambient `http` endpoint,
aggregates `AddHealthCheck` registrations and DI-registered `Hosting.Health` `IHealthContributor` s,
observes ambient endpoints, and attaches the built host for graceful stop. A fixed terminal layer
wraps the final resolved pipeline — including a pipeline supplied through
`IWebApplicationBuilder.AddPipeline` — so it always runs before user dispatch. It serves `/healthz`
, `/readyz`, and `/livez` plus their `/cohesion/v1/healthz`, `/cohesion/v1/readyz`, and
`/cohesion/v1/livez` aliases, together with `/cohesion/v1/endpoints`, `/cohesion/v1/stop`, and
`/cohesion/v1/commands`.

The default server installs the public Web-root `IWebResponseCompletionFeature` contract with an
internal implementation on each exchange. The stop terminal uses it to register the host shutdown
signal, returns `202 Accepted`, and lets the server invoke that signal only after `SendAsync` has
written the response. This keeps the control-plane route terminal while preventing server
cancellation from racing delivery of its own acknowledgement.

The terminal is shared from `Web.Hosting.Resources` (O35); the private copy is deleted.
Gateway-managed contexts require an ES256 bootstrap JWT for every `/cohesion/v1/*` route:
application issuer, gateway subject, resource audience, key id, signature, required claims, and at
most 24 hours of lifetime. Invalid tokens return 401 with a Bearer challenge; a valid token for
another audience returns 403 without a challenge. Bare probes remain public. No gateway name means
unauthenticated routes, even when the context carries a credential.

`Build` validates managed identity and the public P-256 trust key only when an ambient http/https
listener is bound. A managed control plane without a listener still builds. The pipeline factory
captures the observed http/https port lazily once; if it is unknown, the wrapper forwards to user
dispatch without calling the terminal. The shared terminal itself treats null as no port gate, which
preserves filler behavior. A known port gates all paths, including bare probes.

This module consumes the plain `Hosting` lifecycle plus the opt-in `Hosting.Resources`
runtime/control-plane and `Hosting.Health` contribution contracts. It never references
`Web.ApplicationModel` or `Web.Health`, preserving `COHRES002`. The no-argument and options overloads
remain plain applications: they install no control-plane terminal, so the ordinary bodyless-404
fallback handles those paths.

## Default application configuration

`WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args)` composes the application configuration in increasing precedence
order:

1. optional `appsettings.json`;
2. optional `appsettings.{Environment}.json`;
3. process environment variables prefixed with `COHESION_CONFIG__` (the prefix is
   removed and double underscores become configuration path separators);
4. command-line arguments.

The environment file name remains generic: `Local` selects `appsettings.Local.json`, and
`Development` selects `appsettings.Development.json`. `Local` denotes a developer machine;
`Development` denotes a deployable environment. Neither file is an alias for the other, and the
unset environment default remains `Production`.

The JSON files resolve from the ambient `Hosting.Resources` `ResourceContext.ContentRootPath` for an
enabled resource and from `AppContext.BaseDirectory` otherwise. An in-process gateway supplies
settings directly on that ambient `ResourceContext`, rather than mutating process-wide environment
variables. The builder folds those settings into the deployment-setting layer before the caller's
command-line arguments, so the same keys work in process and out of process while explicit arguments
retain the highest precedence. The implementation uses only Cohesion's JSON, environment, and
command-line configuration providers; it adds no reflection binder or `Microsoft.Extensions.*`
dependency.

## Configuration-bound server limits and endpoints

### What it is

`WebApplicationServerBuilder.UseConfiguration(IConfiguration, sectionKey = "Http")` (an extension
member in `WebHostingExtensions`) binds the server's listener **endpoints** and **server limits**
from a Cohesion `IConfiguration` section at builder time, giving `appsettings` -style
Kestrel-section parity:

```json
"Http": {
  "Endpoints": {
    "Primary": { "Protocol": "Http1", "Host": "localhost", "Port": 8080 }
  },
  "Limits": {
    "MaxRequestLineSize": 8192,
    "MaxRequestBodySize": 30000000,
    "KeepAliveTimeout": "00:02:10",
    "RequestHeadersTimeout": "00:00:30"
  }
}
```

The actual binding lives in the internal `HttpServerConfiguration.Bind`, invoked from inside the
`UseServer((serviceProvider, options) => …)` callback so it runs when the `HttpConnectionListener`
is composed. Limits are per HTTP version on the transport, so the single `Limits` section is parsed
eagerly (an unparseable value fails loudly even with no endpoints) into an
`Http1ConnectionListenerOptions.Http1Limits` template, and each endpoint the section registers
copies the bound values into its own per-registration limits through the transport's `UseHttp1` /
`UseHttp2` configure overloads — HTTP/1.1 endpoints receive every key; HTTP/2 endpoints receive the
shared `HttpConnectionListenerLimits` keys (`MaxRequestBodySize`, `KeepAliveTimeout`,
`RequestHeadersTimeout`), because the HTTP/1.1 wire-format keys have no HTTP/2 meaning. The HTTP/2
abuse caps (`Http2ConnectionListenerOptions.Http2Limits`) are not yet config-bindable — a
`Limits:Http2` section is a natural follow-up when a deployment needs it.

### Why explicit, hand-rolled binding

The binding is deliberately **not** reflection-based:

- **AOT is a hard repo requirement.** A reflection binder (`Bind<T>` over
  property setters) is exactly the pattern trimming and NativeAOT break. Every
  value is instead read by its known path (`GetValue`) and parsed with the
  invariant culture. There is no dynamic member discovery and no
  `Microsoft.Extensions.*` dependency.
- **Security config must fail loudly.** A mistyped limit is a security
  regression waiting to happen (`MaxRequestBodySize: "1O485760"` silently
  falling back to a default would be dangerous). A value that is *present but
  unparseable* throws; a value that is *absent* leaves the built-in
  Kestrel-parity default in place. The two cases are never conflated.

### Binding specifics

- **Body size.** `"unbounded"` / `"none"` bind to `null` (no cap); otherwise a
  non-negative integer.
- **Timeouts.** A `TimeSpan` string (`"00:00:30"`), a bare whole number of
  seconds, or `"infinite"` / `"-1"` for `Timeout.InfiniteTimeSpan`.
- **Endpoint host.** Literal IP addresses, `localhost` (→ loopback), and the
  wildcards `*` / `+` / `0.0.0.0` (→ any) / `[::]` / `::` (→ IPv6 any). DNS is
  **not** resolved at bind time — a hostname that is not one of those is an
  error, because binding-time DNS is an I/O surprise the composition root should
  not hide.
- **Endpoint protocol.** `Http1` (default), `Http2`, `Https`/`Http1s`, or `Http2s`; anything else throws. TLS endpoints use `Certificate` to name a Secret mount.

### Scope boundary

`UseConfiguration` binds HTTP and HTTPS endpoints and their protocol-specific server limits. HTTP/3
registration and the connection-dispatch rewrite are separate concerns (the latter under #762).
Data-rate limits are deferred with the transport's streaming-body rework.

### AOT posture

No reflection, no codegen, no dynamic activation. The binder is straight-line `GetValue` /
`TryParse` calls; endpoints are wired through the already-AOT-safe TCP convenience overloads.

## Default request-parse interceptors

### What it is

When the web host composes the `HttpConnectionListener`, it installs the default request-parse
interceptors **before** any user `UseServer` configuration runs
(`WebApplicationServerBuilder.ApplyDefaultInterceptors`). Today that is one interceptor:
`Http.RequestLimits` ' max-request-body-size interceptor, which occupies slot 0 of the interceptor
order so every request carries the typed `IHttpMaxRequestBodySizeFeature` and user-registered
interceptors' `AfterRequestHead` hooks can observe it. As of #819 the seam is invoked on **all
three** parse paths — HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3 — so the feature is attached uniformly regardless
of protocol. Cap *enforcement* (the
413) is still HTTP/1.1-only: h2 bounds body buffering via flow-control
backpressure and h3 via QUIC flow control, so a lowered cap changes the reported feature value but
does not reject the body there yet (the hard cap is tracked in the transport's protocol-coverage
notes and on `HttpConnectionListenerLimits.MaxRequestBodySize`).

### Why default-on, and why here

The transport itself stays lean — with zero interceptors it allocates no per-request interception
state at all — so the "every request always has the typed feature" guarantee is a *hosting* policy,
not a transport one. It lives here because this is the composition root: apps that want a leaner
pipeline can inspect or clear `HttpConnectionListenerOptions.Interceptors` in their own `UseServer`
callback (user configurations run after the defaults), which keeps the default overridable without a
dedicated opt-out knob.

### Non-goals

No other interceptor ships by default. `Parse`-time features under design (digest fields, request
decompression) register through the same seam when their packages land, but each is an explicit
opt-in.

## TLS convenience surface

### What it is

`HttpConnectionListenerOptions.UseHttp1s(configure, tlsOptions)` and
`UseHttp2s(configure, tlsOptions)` (extension members in `WebHostingExtensions`) are the secure
siblings of the plaintext `UseHttp1` / `UseHttp2` callback sugar. Each takes the same
`Action<TcpConnectionListenerOptions>` used to configure the endpoint plus a `TlsServerOptions`,
and registers a listener that serves the protocol over TLS:

See the [source-backed usage examples](examples/index.md).

### Why here, and why compose-before-register

TLS is a **pre-composed transport layer**, never an HTTP concern — the
`Assimalign.Cohesion.Http.Connections` `docs/DESIGN.md` records this boundary ("TLS is a
pre-composed layer, not an HTTP concern"), and its `HttpConnectionListenerOptions` deliberately
carries no TLS or certificate options. The convenience honors that boundary by composing
`TcpConnectionListener.Create(configure).UseTls(tlsOptions)` **before** handing the listener to
`UseHttp1` / `UseHttp2`. Composition is deferred inside the same factory the plaintext sugar uses,
so the TCP listener is not bound until the `HttpConnectionListener` materializes the registration.

Because the security layer wraps the listener first, the layered listener reports
`Capabilities.Security == ConnectionSecurity.Tls`. That capability is the single source of truth
for the `https` scheme — the HTTP layer reads it once per accept loop; there is no registration-time
`isSecure` parameter to thread through. A request served over a `UseHttp1s` / `UseHttp2s` listener
therefore carries `HttpScheme.Https` end to end.

This is also the layering reason the surface lives in Web.Hosting rather than in the transport:
Web.Hosting is where the composition root is allowed to depend on both `Http.Connections` (the
registration surface) and `Connections.Security` (the `UseTls` layer). The transport depends on
neither direction of that composition.

### ALPN defaulting

The .NET / browser HTTP client selects the HTTP version over TLS via ALPN (RFC 7301), so a secured
HTTP/2 listener is only reachable as HTTP/2 if it advertises the `h2` protocol id. To make the
common case work without ceremony, `UseHttp2s` defaults `AuthenticationOptions.ApplicationProtocols`
to `SslApplicationProtocol.Http2` (`h2`) and `UseHttp1s` defaults it to
`SslApplicationProtocol.Http11` (`http/1.1`) **when the caller left the list unset** (null or
empty). A caller who supplies an explicit protocol list — for example to offer both `h2` and
`http/1.1` on one endpoint — has it preserved unmodified. The default is written onto the caller's
`TlsServerOptions` (an intentional mutation) so a later read observes the negotiated protocol.

### Certificates are the caller's concern

The server certificate is supplied by the caller through
`TlsServerOptions.AuthenticationOptions.ServerCertificate` (or a selection callback). Certificate
sourcing, storage, and rotation are Security-area concerns and are explicit non-goals of the
security library's TLS surface, so they are not re-modeled on this convenience.

### Scope boundary

`UseHttp1s` / `UseHttp2s` cover the stream protocols. HTTP/3 has its own always-on-TLS surface —
QUIC's transport security is inherent and QUIC listeners bind asynchronously — documented in "HTTP/3
(QUIC) registration surface" below (issue #767).

### AOT posture

No reflection, no runtime codegen. The composition is plain delegate wiring
(`TcpConnectionListener.Create(...).UseTls(...)` inside a `Func<IConnectionListener>`), and the
ALPN default is a list assignment. `IsAotCompatible=true` holds with no special handling.

## HTTP/3 (QUIC) registration surface

### What it is

`HttpConnectionListenerOptions.UseHttp3(configure)` and `UseHttp3(configure, tlsOptions)` (extension
members in `WebHostingExtensions`) register an HTTP/3 listener over QUIC — the h3 counterpart of
the TCP `UseHttp1s` / `UseHttp2s` sugar:

See the [source-backed usage examples](examples/index.md).

There is no plaintext `UseHttp3`: QUIC's transport security is always-on (TLS 1.3 is inherent to
the protocol, RFC 9001), so both members register a secured listener whose
`Capabilities.Security == ConnectionSecurity.Tls`, and the HTTP layer derives the `https` scheme
from that capability exactly as it does for `UseHttp1s` / `UseHttp2s`. A request served over an h3
listener carries `HttpScheme.Https` and reports `HttpVersion.Http30`.

Two overloads, one for each certificate-configuration ergonomic:

- **`UseHttp3(Action<QuicConnectionListenerOptions>)`** — the QUIC-native form. The
  callback configures the endpoint, the certificate (through
  `ServerAuthenticationOptions.ServerCertificate` — the QUIC equivalent of the
  `TlsServerOptions` surface), stream limits, and error codes in one place,
  mirroring the `Http.Connections` HTTP/3 example.
- **`UseHttp3(Action<QuicConnectionListenerOptions>, TlsServerOptions)`** — the
  cross-protocol-consistent form. The certificate flows through the *same*
  `TlsServerOptions` type as `UseHttp1s` / `UseHttp2s`; its `AuthenticationOptions`
  becomes the QUIC listener's `ServerAuthenticationOptions`, leaving the callback for
  the endpoint and QUIC tunables. This is the exact ergonomic mirror of
  `UseHttp2s(configure, tlsOptions)`.

Both default the ALPN application-protocol list to `h3` and the enabled TLS protocols to TLS 1.3
when the caller leaves them unset (a caller-supplied list is preserved unmodified); the
`TlsServerOptions` overload applies those defaults eagerly to the passed options so a later read
observes them, matching `UseHttp2s`.

### Async binding without sync-over-async

The registration surface remains synchronous: its deferred factory constructs an *unbound*
`QuicConnectionListener` and returns it immediately. Resource acquisition does not occur in the
factory or in the `HttpConnectionListener` constructor. The aggregate listener's asynchronous
`BindAsync` awaits the QUIC driver's asynchronous bind from `WebApplicationServer.StartAsync`,
alongside every configured stream listener. This removes the previous sync-over-async bridge and
makes TCP and QUIC obey the same explicit start/release lifecycle. The callback is still deferred
until the HTTP listener materializes, so configuration time remains resource-free.

### Platform posture

`System.Net.Quic` is available only on Windows, Linux, and macOS, and only when the platform ships a
usable QUIC implementation (for example libmsquic). The h3 members are annotated
`[SupportedOSPlatform("windows"/"linux"/"macos")]` to match the QUIC driver, so a call site on
another OS is flagged by the platform-compatibility analyzer. At run time, when the platform lacks
QUIC support (`QuicListener.IsSupported` is `false`), awaited binding throws
`PlatformNotSupportedException` **at start**, propagated from `QuicConnectionListener.BindAsync`.
The tests gate on `QuicListener.IsSupported` and assert the bind on supported platforms or the
`PlatformNotSupportedException` otherwise, so a CI machine without QUIC never hard-fails.

### Coexistence and Alt-Svc composition

h1/h2/h3 register simultaneously on one `HttpConnectionListenerOptions` (different endpoints), and
each accepted exchange reports its own scheme and protocol — the QUIC listener's
`Capabilities.Security = Tls` yields `https` / `Http30`, independent of any coexisting TCP
listener. HTTP/3 `Alt-Svc` advertisement (issue #754) needs no extra wiring from this surface:
`UseHttp3` registers the multiplexed listener that `HttpConnectionListener` reads when it computes
the RFC 7838 `Alt-Svc` header, and the advertised port is taken from that listener's bound endpoint.
An application opts in with `options.AdvertiseAltService(...)` alongside a stream listener; the
server then injects `Alt-Svc: h3=":<port>"` on the h1/h2 responses so clients can discover and
upgrade to h3.

### h3 response round-trip — verified end to end

The registration surface, the QUIC bind, the h3 connection accept, pipeline dispatch (scheme +
protocol), **and the full client response round-trip** (HTTP/3 status + body) are verified end to
end against a real .NET HTTP/3 client (`WebHttp3HostingIntegrationTests`). The client round-trip was
previously best-effort because of a pre-existing HTTP/3 *server send-path* defect in
`Assimalign.Cohesion.Http.Connections` (issue #928): the request stream was never ended when a
response completed, so the client's response-content read never finished and surfaced the eventual
connection teardown as `H3_CLOSED_CRITICAL_STREAM` (0x104). That defect is fixed in
`Http.Connections` (the send path now ends the request stream per RFC 9114 §4.1), so the e2e test
asserts the client-observed status and body alongside the server-side dispatch observation.

### AOT posture

No reflection, no runtime codegen, and no sync-over-async bridge. Registration is plain delegate
wiring; the ALPN/TLS defaults are list/enum assignments; awaited transport binding uses ordinary
`ValueTask` APIs. `IsAotCompatible=true` holds with no special handling.

## HTTPS endpoint certificate contract (31t)

The enabled resource's `http` listener consumes the shared Hosting.Resources endpoint certificate
accessor. Endpoint metadata identifies an ordinary Secret mount (default `tls`), carrying one PEM
leaf/private-key/chain document; existing hand-authored IdentityHub and LogSpace bundles retain the
same format. Empty mounts are absent; malformed or multi-key bundles fail. TLS options are composed
in Hosting from the returned leaf and chain, with no hosting-isolation exemptions or dependency
changes. Plain application composition is unchanged. Ambient binding tries http and then https by
endpoint name, admitting both URI schemes. Manual Http:Endpoints configuration also accepts Protocol
Https/Http1s/Http2s and Certificate as a mount name. `Server.UseConfiguration` remains opt-in and is
not wired by default.

## Optional telemetry (31b)

The registered resource constructor calls ResourceTelemetry.Configure using the invocation snapshot.
With no gateway or telemetry endpoint, existing providers and hosted services are unchanged. When
enabled, the shared Hosting.Telemetry sibling adds OTLP/HTTP JSON logging and a service registered
before producers; reverse `StopAsync` drains producers before a flush bounded by five seconds and the
host shutdown token. Logging remains composed only in Hosting. See
libraries/Hosting/`Assimalign.Cohesion.Hosting.Telemetry`/docs/DESIGN.md for ordering and protocol
limits.

## Hosting family (O34)

The root contracts and feature libraries reference no `Assimalign.Cohesion.Hosting*` library.
`Web.Hosting.Resources` and `Web.Hosting.Health` own reusable hosting integration. They never
reference this runtime module. `COHRES002` still permits this module to reference only the Web root,
so its internal control-plane terminal stays independent of `Web.Hosting.Resources`; consolidation
is the 31f follow-up.
