# Web Application Exchange Feature Capacity Tests

This example exercises `Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Hosting` through its co-located test source.

> **Status:** Partial.

The example reproduces
`cohesion/resources/Web/Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Hosting/tests/WebApplicationExchangeFeatureCapacityTests.cs`.
It retains the test class and assertions so the setup, operation, and expected outcome stay
together. Use it in the source project’s test context, with its test dependencies and supporting
test objects.

## Behavior exercised

- **Case 1** — Feature capacity: The counted features should equal the features a plain exchange carries.
- **Case 2** — Feature capacity: A replacement pipeline stamps no application features, so the count should hold only the host's.
- **Case 3** — Feature capacity: Slots a configuration adds should be rounded with the host's count.
- **Case 4** — Feature capacity: Rounding should pick the smallest size an unsized collection grows through.
- **Case 5** — Feature capacity: An exchange carrying more features than counted should allocate no more than an unsized collection.

/// features the pipeline stamps plus the features the host always installs, sets the listener's
/// <c>ExchangeFeatureCapacity</c> to that count before the listener configurations run, and rounds what
/// they leave up to a size an unsized collection grows through. These tests pin the count against a real
/// exchange, so a feature the host starts installing on every exchange without counting it fails here,
/// and they pin the rounding: an exchange carrying more features than counted, such as routing's route
/// match, must never allocate more than an unsized collection would.
