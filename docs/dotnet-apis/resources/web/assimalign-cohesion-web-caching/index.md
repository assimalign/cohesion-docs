# Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Caching

Server-owned HTTP output caching for the Cohesion Web pipeline: a middleware plus policy layer that serves a stored response to a repeat request without invoking the endpoint, over an async, tag-aware store built on Cohesion's owned cache foundation.

Server-owned HTTP **output caching** for the Cohesion Web pipeline: a middleware plus policy layer
that serves a stored response to a repeat request **without invoking the endpoint**, over an async,
tag-aware store built on Cohesion's owned cache foundation. It is the middleware consumer of the RFC
9111 typed primitives from `Assimalign.Cohesion.Http` (#755) — it re-implements no header parsing.

## Purpose and scope

- **Cache cacheable GET/HEAD responses** at the server, needing no client participation — the standard
  enterprise capability for high-traffic API and page workloads.
- **Policy model at builder time**: a base policy applied to every request, named policies, and
  per-endpoint overrides through a sealed metadata carrier read from the endpoint `UseRouting` publishes.
- **Correct cache-or-bypass decisions** via the #755 typed `Cache-Control` primitives: bypass on
  `no-store`/`private`/`Set-Cookie`, on non-safe methods, and on non-`200` responses; never cache
  authenticated responses by default.
- **Vary-correct**: the stored response's own `Vary` header partitions the cache key (RFC 9111 §4.1), so
  a compressed or content-negotiated variant is never served to a client that cannot accept it.
- **`Tag`-based invalidation** reachable from application code.

## Dependencies

- **`Assimalign.Cohesion.Web`** — the root pipeline-builder seam the `UseOutputCache` verb composes against.
- **`Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Routing`** — the published route match (endpoint, route values) and the endpoint-metadata seam.
- **`Assimalign.Cohesion.Http`** — the `IHttpContext` surface and the #755 `HttpCacheControl` / `HttpFreshness`
  primitives.
- **`Assimalign.Cohesion.Http.Forwarded`** — the effective scheme and host the primary key is built from
  (forwarded by a trusted proxy when `UseForwardedHeaders` runs first, otherwise the wire values).
- **`Assimalign.Cohesion.Http.Streaming`** — the `IHttpResponseStreamingFeature.HasStarted` guard.
- **`Assimalign.Cohesion.Caching` / `Assimalign.Cohesion.Caching.InMemory`** — the synchronous cache
  foundation the default in-memory store adapts.

It never references `Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Hosting` (the resource hosting-isolation rule,
`COHRES001`).

## Usage

See the [source-backed usage examples](examples/index.md).

Register `UseOutputCache` **after** `UseRouting`, and **before** `UseResponseCompression` and any
content-negotiated write (see `DESIGN.md` for why the ordering is load-bearing). Registered ahead of
`UseRouting`, only the base policy applies: endpoint metadata cannot opt an endpoint in, and a
response from an endpoint that carries it is never stored, so an opt-out still holds.

## Documentation

  the QUERY posture, size accounting, and non-goals.
