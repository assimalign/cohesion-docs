Browser security headers for the Cohesion Web pipeline. One verb, `UseSecurityHeaders`, puts safe
defaults on every response that passes through it and lets an application opt into a Content
Security Policy (with per-request nonces), a Permissions Policy, and the cross-origin isolation
fields. Endpoints can adjust, replace or disable the policy through routing metadata.

## What it provides

- **`UseSecurityHeaders(Action<SecurityHeadersPolicy>?)`** — a pipeline verb on
  `IWebApplicationPipelineBuilder`. With no configuration it emits:
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`;
  - clickjacking protection: `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'` and
    `X-Frame-Options: DENY`;
  - `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`.
- Opt-in fields on `SecurityHeadersPolicy`: `ContentSecurityPolicy` and
  `ContentSecurityPolicyReportOnly` (built with `ContentSecurityPolicy.Create`), `PermissionsPolicy`
  (built with `PermissionsPolicy.Create`), `CrossOriginOpenerPolicy`, `CrossOriginEmbedderPolicy`
  and `CrossOriginResourcePolicy`. `Framing` (a `FramingPolicy`) changes or removes the clickjacking
  protection; `ReferrerPolicy` changes or removes the referrer policy.
- Validating builders. `ContentSecurityPolicyBuilder` and `PermissionsPolicyBuilder` check every
  directive, source, feature name and origin against its specification's grammar when the policy is
  built, so a policy that would not parse the way it reads fails at startup instead of being partly
  ignored by the browser.
- A per-request nonce. `ContentSecurityPolicySourceListBuilder.Nonce()` puts a `'nonce-…'` source in
  a directive; handlers read the exchange's value from `ISecurityHeadersFeature.Nonce` and stamp it
  on their inline `<script>` and `<style>` elements.
- Endpoint overrides, as convention verbs on mapped routes and route groups:
  `WithSecurityHeaders(policy => ...)` adjusts a copy of the pipeline's policy,
  `WithSecurityHeaders(policy)` replaces it, and `DisableSecurityHeaders()` turns the fields off.
  Responses that never reach an endpoint keep the pipeline's policy.

A field the application set itself is never overwritten, unless
`SecurityHeadersPolicy.OverwriteExistingHeaders` says so. An application that sets
`X-Frame-Options`, or a `Content-Security-Policy` with a `frame-ancestors` directive, owns framing,
and the middleware then emits neither framing field.

## Usage

See the [source-backed usage examples](examples/index.md).

Register `UseSecurityHeaders` at the front of the pipeline, where only `UseHttpLogging` goes ahead
of it, and ahead of the exception boundary: every response then passes through it, and the fields
are staged after the boundary has written an error page.

## Dependencies

- **`Assimalign.Cohesion.Web`** — the pipeline abstractions the verb extends.
- **`Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Routing`** — endpoint metadata and the convention-builder seam the
  override verbs extend.
- **`Assimalign.Cohesion.Http`** — the header keys, the feature collection, and the Structured Field
  toolkit `Permissions-Policy` is serialized with.
- **`Assimalign.Cohesion.Http.Streaming`** — the response-streaming feature, which the middleware
  stands in for so a streamed response carries the fields too.

No DI, configuration, or logging dependency: the policy is captured and compiled when the verb is
called, and the middleware resolves nothing per request. Delivered to applications through the
`App.Web` shared framework (via `Sdk.Web`), with no project wiring required. `docs/DESIGN.md`
records when the fields are written, the no-clobber and framing rules, the override model, the
nonce, and the non-goals. HSTS is not part of this package; it is `UseHsts` in
`Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.HttpsPolicy`.
