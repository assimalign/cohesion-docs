Deterministic, standards-aware HTTP route matching for the Cohesion Web stack. This is an **L3**
service-platform library: it consumes the L1 `Assimalign.Cohesion.Http` protocol primitives and is
consumed by the higher-level web programming models (API, functions, controllers, metadata,
results).

## What it does

- **Parses route templates (`/users/{id:int}/assets/{name}.{ext?}`,** — catch-alls, defaults,
  inline constraints) into an immutable `RoutePattern`.
- **Matches an inbound request** — against a set of routes with correct **precedence** (a literal
  segment beats a parameter segment regardless of registration order).
- **Distinguishes **404** (no route** — matched the path) from **405** (a route matched the path
  but not the method), emitting an RFC 9110 `Allow` header for the latter.
- **Accepts **multiple HTTP methods**** — per route and serves **HEAD** from a matching **GET**
  route (RFC 9110 §9.3.2).
- **`Applies`** — **inline constraints** that both validate and, for type constraints (`int`, `long`,
  `decimal`, `double`, `float`, `bool`, `guid`, `datetime`), **convert** the value to its CLR type —
  parsed once, invariant culture — plus text/value validators (`length`, `minlength`, `maxlength`,
  `min`, `max`, `range`, `regex`, `alpha`, `when`).
- **Composes **route groups** (`MapGroup`) at builder time** — a prefix (which may itself contain
  parameters, e.g. `{tenant}/api`), shared parameter policies, and shared endpoint metadata are
  merged onto each child route **at registration**, so grouped routes match at exactly the cost
  of directly-mapped ones and participate normally in precedence.
- **Carries an immutable, typed** — **endpoint-metadata bag** on each route and surfaces the
  **route-match result** (route + typed values + metadata) as a strongly-typed HTTP feature — the
  reflection-free seam that auth, docs, and observability consume.
- **`Supports`** — **host-constrained routes** (exact hosts, `*.wildcard` subdomains, `host:port`,
  IPv6 literals) declared as endpoint metadata and evaluated during candidate selection:
  non-matching hosts fall through to other candidates, and host-constrained routes outrank
  unconstrained ties.
- **Keeps routing state **per** — application** (no process-wide shared builder), so multiple web
  applications hosted in one process have fully isolated route tables.
- **Generates **outbound URLs** (`ILinkGenerator`)** — routes register a unique, case-insensitive
  **name** via metadata (duplicates fail at build time), and paths or absolute URIs are generated
  from a name — or from route values alone, resolved by outbound precedence — honoring defaults,
  collapsing omitted optionals/catch-alls, re-validating constraints, escaping per path segment,
  and appending surplus values as a query string.

## `Key` types

| Type | Role |
|------|------|
| `RoutePattern` / `RoutePatternParser` | Parsed, immutable template shape and its parser. |
| `RoutePrecedence` | Computes inbound (match) and outbound (URL-gen) precedence. |
| `Route` | A pattern + the HTTP methods it accepts + a handler + its endpoint metadata. |
| `Router` | Evaluates routes by precedence; produces a `RouteMatch`. |
| `RouteMatch` / `RouteMatchStatus` | The match outcome: `Matched`, `MethodNotAllowed`, `NoMatch`. |
| `RouteParameterPolicy` / `TypedRouteParameterPolicy` | Inline constraint base types. `TypedRouteParameterPolicy` validates **and** converts (parse-once); the public extension point for custom typed constraints. |
| `RouteParameterPolicyMap` | Resolves inline policy names (`int`, `guid`, `length(n)`, `min(n)`, `range(a,b)`, …) to executable policies; `CreateDefault()` registers the built-ins. |
| `IRouterRouteMetadataCollection` / `RouterRouteMetadataCollection` | Immutable, ordered, reflection-free endpoint-metadata bag (`GetMetadata<T>` is last-wins). |
| `IRouterGroupBuilder` / `RouterBuilderExtensions.MapGroup` | Builder-time route groups: prefix + shared policies + shared metadata composed onto children at registration; nestable; child-over-group overrides. |
| `RouteHostConstraint` | Parsed host constraint (`host[:port]`, `*.wildcard`, `*`, bracketed IPv6) with `Parse`/`TryParse`/`IsMatch`. |
| `RouteHostMetadata` | Sealed endpoint-metadata carrier declaring the hosts a route accepts; consulted by `Router` during candidate selection. |
| `IRouteMatchFeature` | The per-request feature carrying the matched route, its values, and its metadata. |
| `RouteNameMetadata` | Sealed endpoint-metadata carrier naming a route for URL generation; unique per router, checked at build time. |
| `ILinkGenerator` | Outbound URL generation (`GetPathByName`, `GetUriByName`, `TryGetPathByValues`, …); exposed as `IRouter.LinkGenerator` and via `context.GetLinkGenerator()`. |
| `HttpContextRoutingExtensions` | `SetRouteMatch` / `GetRouteMatch` / `TryGetRoute` / `TryGetRouteValues` / `GetEndpointMetadata`(`<T>`) / `GetLinkGenerator` over the routing features. |
| `RoutingExtensions.UseRouting` | Pipeline integration (dispatch / 405 / fall-through). |

## Usage

See the [source-backed usage examples](examples/index.md).

Within a web application pipeline, prefer `builder.UseRouting()`, which performs this dispatch
(invoke handler / emit 405 + `Allow` / fall through to the next middleware) for you.

Outbound, a route named through its metadata generates URLs back out of the same table:

See the [source-backed usage examples](examples/index.md).

In request handlers, resolve the application's generator with `context.GetLinkGenerator()`.

## Design

See [docs/DESIGN.md](design.md) for the matcher pipeline, the precedence scheme, the 405-vs-404
model, the HEAD→GET fallback, AOT posture, and the routing features delivered by sibling issues
(metadata, groups, link generation, source-gen binding).
