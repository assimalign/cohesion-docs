# Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Routing design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Routing`.

> **Status:** Partial.

## Purpose

This library turns a set of registered route templates into a deterministic decision: given an
inbound `IHttpContext`, which handler (if any) should run, and — when none should — whether that is
a *no route* (404) or a *wrong method* (405) situation. It also carries the **endpoint metadata**
each route declares and surfaces the **route-match result** to the rest of the pipeline as a typed
feature. It is a foundation primitive: the API, function, controller, and metadata programming
models (issues #149, #151, #787, #788,
#796) all build on the matcher, the typed route values, and the metadata seam defined here, so
their behavior must be predictable, standards-aware, and reflection-free before those layers are
added.

Scope of this library:

- **`Route`** — **template parsing** into an immutable `RoutePattern` (`Patterns/`).
- **`Route`** — **parameter policies / constraints** (`Policies/`) evaluated during matching.
- **A **route** (`Route`) that** — binds a pattern, the HTTP methods it accepts, a handler, and
  its **endpoint metadata**.
- **A **router** (`Router`) that** — evaluates routes against a request with correct precedence
  and HTTP method semantics.
- **An **endpoint metadata bag**** — (`IRouterRouteMetadataCollection`) and a **route-match feature**
  (`IRouteMatchFeature`) — the reflection-free seam auth, docs, and observability consume (#150).
  Metadata objects (the bag and the built-in carriers) live under `Metadata/` in the
  `Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Routing.Metadata` namespace, mirroring the `Patterns`/`Policies` areas.
  The read contract `IRouterRouteMetadataCollection` stays in `Abstractions/` at the root namespace
  with the other routing interfaces.
- **Host-constrained matching** (`RouteHostConstraint` + `RouteHostMetadata`, in `Metadata/`),
  evaluated during candidate selection off the metadata bag (#788).
- **`Route` groups** (`IRouterGroupBuilder`, via `MapGroup`) — builder-time composition of a path
  prefix, shared parameter policies, and shared endpoint metadata onto child routes (#786).
- **Named routes and outbound URL generation** (`RouteNameMetadata` in `Metadata/`,
  `ILinkGenerator`) — the inverse direction: from a route name (or route values) back to a path
  or absolute URI (#787).
- **Minimal **pipeline integration** (`UseRouting`)** — so a web application can dispatch through
  the router.

## The matcher pipeline

```text
raw template ──RoutePatternParser──▶ RoutePattern ──┐
                                                     ├─▶ Route ──┐
     HttpMethod[] ─────────────────────────────────-┘           ├─▶ Router ──▶ RouteMatch
                                                                 │
     IRouterRouteHandler ────────────────────────────────────---┘
```

- **`RoutePattern`** is the parsed, immutable shape of a template: an ordered list of path
  segments (literals, separators, parameters), the parameters and their inline policies,
  defaults, required values, and the precomputed inbound/outbound precedence.
- **`Route`** pairs a pattern with the set of HTTP methods it accepts, the handler to
  invoke, and its endpoint metadata. Matching is split into two phases (see below).
- **`Router`** owns the collection of routes and produces a `RouteMatch` for a request.

### Two-phase matching (path, then method)

`IRouterRoute` exposes matching as two operations rather than one:

- **`TryMatchPath(context, out values)`** — matches the request **path** and validates parameter
  policies, **ignoring** the HTTP method.
- **`TryMatch(context, out values)`** — the full match: `TryMatchPath` **and** the request method
  is accepted.

Splitting the phases is what lets the router tell a genuine 404 apart from a 405. If any route
matches the path but none accepts the method, the correct response is `405 Method Not Allowed` with
an `Allow` header — not `404 Not Found`. A single combined predicate (the original design)
collapsed both into "no match" and could never produce a 405. This split is the seam the whole
405-vs-404 behavior hangs on.

## Precedence ordering (fix for the insertion-order defect)

Each `RoutePattern` carries an `InboundPrecedence` (a `decimal`) computed by `RoutePrecedence`.
Every segment contributes one digit at a decreasing decimal place, where a **lower** digit is **more
specific**:

| `Segment` kind                         | Digit |
|--------------------------------------|-------|
| Literal                              | 1     |
| Constrained parameter / multi-part   | 2     |
| Unconstrained parameter              | 3     |
| Constrained catch-all                | 4     |
| Unconstrained catch-all              | 5     |

So `/api/status` = `1.1`, `/api/{id:int}` = `1.2`, `/api/{id}` = `1.3`. **Lower is more specific
and must be evaluated first.**

The original `Router` computed precedence but never used it — it matched routes in **insertion
order** and returned the first hit. That meant registering `/api/{id}` before `/api/status` shadowed
the literal: a request for `/api/status` matched the parameter route. `Router` now sorts its
candidates **once at construction** by ascending `InboundPrecedence`, breaking ties first by **host
rank** (host-constrained routes ahead of unconstrained ones — see the host-constrained matching
section) and then by **registration order** (a stable, deterministic total order via the
`PrecedenceKey` comparer). `Routes` still enumerates in registration order; only the internal
evaluation list is reordered.

Method acceptance can still override raw precedence: the router walks candidates in precedence order
and returns the first whose path **and** method both match. A higher-precedence route that matches
the path but not the method does not block a lower-precedence route that matches both — it only
contributes to the `Allow` set if nothing ends up matching.

## HTTP method semantics

### Multiple methods per route

A `Route` accepts a **set** of methods (`Methods`), not a single one. Constructors accept either a
single `HttpMethod` (the common case) or an `IEnumerable<HttpMethod>`. Duplicate methods are
de-duplicated at construction. An **empty** method set means "accept any method" — useful for
catch-all/fallback routes.

### 405 vs 404 and the `Allow` header

`Router.Match` returns a `RouteMatch` with one of three `RouteMatchStatus` values:

- **`Matched`** — a route matched path and method; `Route` and `Values` are populated.
- **`MethodNotAllowed`** — one or more routes matched the path but none accepted the method;
  `AllowedMethods` holds the union of methods those routes accept, and `ToAllowHeaderValue()`
  formats them as an RFC 9110 `Allow` header (`"GET, POST, HEAD"`).
- **`NoMatch`** — nothing matched the path.

`RouteMatch` is a `readonly struct` so the common path allocates nothing beyond the captured route
values.

### HEAD falls back to GET

Per RFC 9110 §9.3.2 a `HEAD` request is answered identically to `GET` (headers only, no body). A
route that maps `GET` but not `HEAD` therefore **accepts** `HEAD`: the router's method- acceptance
check treats `HEAD` as satisfied by a `GET` mapping when `HEAD` is not explicitly mapped.
Symmetrically, a `405` `Allow` header for a `GET` -capable path advertises `HEAD`. An explicit
`HEAD` route still wins for `HEAD` requests, and a `HEAD` -only route does **not** answer `GET`.

The fallback lives in `Router`, not in `Route`. `Route.TryMatch` /`AcceptsMethod` report *exact*
membership so the route's declared surface stays honest; the router layers the RFC synthesis on top.
This keeps `Methods` a truthful description of what was registered while still serving HEAD
correctly end-to-end.

## Host-constrained matching (#788)

Routes can constrain the hosts they serve (multi-tenant hosts, admin-on-internal-host patterns) by
attaching `RouteHostMetadata` to their endpoint metadata (#150):

See the [source-backed usage examples](examples/index.md).

### `Constraint` grammar (`RouteHostConstraint`)

Each pattern is `host[:port]`, where `host` takes one of four forms:

| Form | Example | Matches |
|---|---|---|
| Exact host | `api.example.com` | that host only |
| Wildcard subdomain | `*.example.com` | `api.example.com`, `a.b.example.com` — **not** the apex `example.com` |
| Any host | `*` | every host (useful combined with a port: `*:5000`) |
| IPv6 literal | `[::1]`, `[2001:db8::1]:443` | brackets are the canonical form; comparison strips them, so `::1` denotes the same constraint |

- **Host comparison is **case-insensitive**** — (RFC 9110 §4.2.3 / RFC 3986 §3.2.2); ports compare exactly.
- **A port constraint requires** — the port to be **explicit** in the request's `Host` value. A request
  whose host omits the port (an implied scheme default) does not satisfy a port-constrained route —
  the matcher compares against the Host header as sent, mirroring ASP.NET `RequireHost`.
- **The constraints in one `RouteHostMetadata` are **OR-combined**** — the request host must satisfy any
  one of them.
- **Patterns are parsed **once,** — at metadata construction** (`RouteHostConstraint.Parse`/`TryParse`);
  a malformed pattern throws `RoutePatternException` at the producer, never at match time. The
  parser and matcher are span-based `IndexOf`/`EndsWith` scans — no regex, no reflection, AOT-safe.
- **The `host[:port]` **structural split** — and port parse are shared** with the `Http` layer, not
  reimplemented here: `RouteHostConstraint` delegates both to the public `HttpHost.TrySplitHostPort` /
  `HttpHost.TryParsePort` (#890). This is the same primitive `HttpHostMatcher` (#781) validates
  against, so host **selection** here and host **allowlist validation** there cannot drift on what
  a given wire value means — the bracket rules, single-colon rule, and 1–65535 port range are one
  copy of the logic.
- **The port-unconstrained leniency (deliberate, pinned).** The shared helper is the *structural*
  split only; port digits are validated as a separate step. A route that constrains no port skips
  that step entirely, so an otherwise well-formed request host carrying a **junk or out-of-range
  port** (`example.com:abc`, `example.com:0`) still matches on its host component alone. Selection
  can afford this leniency where the `Http` validation primitive (`HttpHost.TryGetComponents`,
  which fuses the port validation into the split) deliberately rejects the same value. The leniency
  is bounded to a present-but-invalid port: a *structurally* malformed authority (`example.com:`,
  `[::1`, `[::1]x`) fails the shared split and never matches, even a port-unconstrained route.
  `RouteHostConstraintTests` pins both the leniency and its structural boundary.

### Selection semantics (selects, never validates)

The router resolves each route's `RouteHostMetadata` **once at construction** — last-wins via
`GetMetadata<T>()`, so an endpoint-level declaration overrides a group-level one rather than
combining with it — and evaluates the constraints at the top of candidate selection, before path
matching:

- **A candidate whose constraints the request host does not satisfy is **skipped entirely**** — it
  cannot match, and it does **not** contribute its methods to a 405 `Allow` set. A request from a
  non-matching host falls through to the remaining candidates and, when nothing else matches,
  yields a plain `NoMatch` (404) — never a 405 advertising methods the host cannot reach.
- **A candidate whose host** — matches proceeds through the normal path → method phases, so a matching
  host with the wrong method still produces a correct 405 with `Allow`.
- **An **empty** host list (`new RouteHostMetadata()`) declares no constraint** — the route matches any
  host and ranks as unconstrained.

Host evaluation lives in `Router`, not in `Route.TryMatch` /`TryMatchPath` — the same division as
the HEAD-falls-back-to-GET synthesis: the route's two matching phases stay an honest description of
path and method, and candidate-selection concerns layer on top in the router.

**Composition with #781 (host-filtering middleware).** This feature *selects* among routes by host;
it never rejects a request. Validating the request host against an allowlist (→ 400) is the separate
host-filtering middleware's job (#781). The two compose: the middleware guards the edge, and
whatever it admits is routed — possibly onto host-constrained endpoints — by this matcher. Neither
duplicates the other.

### Ordering (the documented tie-break)

Candidate order is, in priority: **path precedence** (ascending `InboundPrecedence`), then **host
rank** (host-constrained ahead of unconstrained), then **registration order**. Concretely:

- **Host rank only breaks *ties* in path precedence** — a literal route still beats a host-constrained
  parameter route for the path the literal names.
- **Two routes with the same pattern, one host-constrained** — the constrained one is evaluated first
  for every request; requests from other hosts fall through to the open one.
- **Two host-constrained ties (e.g** — exact `api.example.com` vs wildcard `*.example.com`) keep
  registration order — exactness deliberately adds no further rank, matching ASP.NET's host
  matcher, which likewise only distinguishes "declares hosts" from "does not".

## Endpoint metadata (#150)

### Intent

Authorization, content negotiation, OpenAPI/documentation and observability all need to answer "what
policy applies to *this* endpoint?" The wrong way to do that under NativeAOT is to reflect over
handler-method attributes at request time — reflection is exactly what trimming and AOT make
unreliable. The right way is to make metadata an **explicit, first-class property of the route**,
populated at build/map time and read back by type at request time.

`IRouterRouteMetadataCollection` is that property. It is:

- **Immutable.** Contents are fixed at construction; there is no `Add`/`Remove`. Composition
  (e.g. a route group merging its metadata into each child) is done by building a *new* collection
  from concatenated items, never by mutating a shared one. Immutability makes a route safe to
  share across concurrent requests without copying.
- **Ordered.** Items keep their registration order. Order is the composition primitive: producers
  layer broader-scope metadata first and narrower-scope metadata last.
- **Typed and reflection-free.** `GetMetadata<T>()` and `GetOrderedMetadata<T>()` resolve purely by
  `is`-tests (assignability), never by reflection, dynamic activation, or attribute scanning. This
  is the Lane-F AOT guardrail: metadata is discovered, never inferred at runtime.

### `GetMetadata<T>` is last-wins

`GetMetadata<T>()` scans **from the end** and returns the first (i.e. last-registered) item
assignable to `T`. This gives the intuitive "most specific declaration wins" behavior when metadata
is layered by scope:

```text
[ group-level AuthMetadata("members"), endpoint-level AuthMetadata("admins") ]
GetMetadata<AuthMetadata>()  ->  AuthMetadata("admins")   // endpoint overrides group
```

`GetOrderedMetadata<T>()` returns **all** matches in registration order, for consumers that
genuinely aggregate. Both accept `where T : class` so the return type is a clean nullable reference,
matching the well-established endpoint-metadata idiom.

### Why a public concrete companion, not a fully-hidden impl

The repo convention is interface-first with `internal` implementations. Value-carrying collections
that downstream code must *construct* are the sanctioned exception, and the library already applies
it (`RouteValueDictionary` is public concrete; `HttpFeatureCollection` is a public concrete
companion to `IHttpFeatureCollection`). `RouterRouteMetadataCollection` follows the same pattern:
`IRouterRouteMetadataCollection` is the read contract consumers depend on, and the public sealed
`RouterRouteMetadataCollection` is the constructor producers (route mapping, route groups, source
generators — some in *other* assemblies) use to build the bag. It rejects `null` items, copies its
source array defensively, and exposes a value-type `Enumerator` for allocation-free `foreach`,
mirroring `RouteValueDictionary.Enumerator` in this same library.

### Metadata items are sealed carriers, not interface-per-concept

The bag's *item* types (e.g. `RouteHostMetadata`) are **sealed concrete data carriers, and the
sealed type is the contract** — there is deliberately no `IRouteHostMetadata` -style interface per
metadata concept. This rejects the ASP.NET convention (`IHostMetadata`, `IHttpMethodMetadata`, …
one interface per concept, attributes implementing them) for three reasons:

- **A data carrier has no behavioral variance to abstract.** Each metadata item is an immutable
  record of declared policy with exactly one plausible implementation; an interface pair per
  concept doubles the public surface without enabling anything.
- **The sealed type guarantees invariants consumers snapshot.** `Router` resolves host constraints
  once at construction; a sealed carrier guarantees the parse-once, immutable list that snapshot
  relies on, where an interface would admit implementations whose contents drift after resolution.
- **The attribute scenario is served better by translation.** Under AOT, the decorator/binding
  layer (#151/#796) translates attributes into carrier construction at map time (the source
  generator emits `new RouteHostMetadata(...)`); attributes implementing metadata interfaces —
  ASP.NET's reason for the convention — would push parsing into attribute property getters.

Type-keyed lookup is unaffected: `GetMetadata<RouteHostMetadata>()` is the same `is` -test scan, and
last-wins layering works identically. **Family rule:** new built-in metadata concepts ship as one
sealed carrier; an interface is introduced only when a second implementation demonstrably needs to
exist. The named-route carrier `RouteNameMetadata` (#787) follows the same rule.

### Metadata lives on the route

`IRouterRoute.Metadata` exposes the bag. `Route` accepts it through metadata-aware constructors; the
pre-existing constructors default to `RouterRouteMetadataCollection.Empty`, so `Metadata` is
**never null**. This keeps the addition additive: existing call sites that build a `Route` without
metadata compile and behave unchanged, and the matcher (`Route.TryMatch`/`TryMatchPath`) is
untouched by the metadata seam.

## `Route`-match state as a typed feature (#150)

### `From` `Items` strings to `Features` types

`Route` match state was previously stashed in `IHttpContext.Items` under two magic-string keys. That
is the loosely-typed, ad-hoc extensibility channel; route match state is neither ad-hoc nor
loosely-typed. It now lives in the strongly-typed `IHttpContext.Features` collection as a single
`IRouteMatchFeature`:

See the [source-backed usage examples](examples/index.md).

`Metadata` is surfaced directly on the feature because, in this routing model, **the matched route
*is* the endpoint** — there is no separate `Endpoint` type to indirect through. Consumers therefore
read one feature and reach the endpoint-metadata seam without a second hop. The feature's `Values`
carry the **typed** route values produced by type constraints (#789), so a consumer reading
`feature.Values["id"]` for `/{id:int}` gets a boxed `int` without re-parsing.

Both `Router.RouteAsync` and the `UseRouting` middleware install the feature via `SetRouteMatch` on
a successful match. Resolution is type-keyed (`context.Features.Get<IRouteMatchFeature>()`), so
there are no shared string constants across assemblies and no reflection — `Get<TFeature>()` is an
`OfType` scan.

### `Extension` surface

`HttpContextRoutingExtensions` is the ergonomic skin over the feature:

| Member | Returns | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `SetRouteMatch(route, values)` | `void` | Installs/replaces the `IRouteMatchFeature`. |
| `GetRouteMatch()` | `IRouteMatchFeature?` | The whole feature, or `null` when unmatched. |
| `TryGetRoute(out route)` | `bool` | `Matched` route, from the feature. |
| `TryGetRouteValues(out values)` | `bool` | Captured values, from the feature. |
| `GetEndpointMetadata()` | `IRouterRouteMetadataCollection` | `Matched` route's metadata, or `Empty`. |
| `GetEndpointMetadata<T>()` | `T?` | Last-wins metadata lookup for the matched endpoint. |

When nothing has matched, the `GetEndpointMetadata*` accessors degrade to `Empty` /`null` rather
than throwing — metadata queries are safe to make unconditionally.

## `Route` groups (#786)

### Registration-time composition — the group disappears before the router exists

`IRouterBuilder.MapGroup(prefix)` (an `extension(...)` member in `RouterBuilderExtensions`) returns
an `IRouterGroupBuilder` — the `MapGroup` equivalent. A group composes three things onto its
children: a **path prefix**, **shared parameter policies**, and **shared endpoint metadata**. The
defining property is *when* composition happens: at **child registration**. Each `group.Map(...)`
joins the group's prefix and the child template as **raw text**, re-parses the composed template
through `RoutePatternParser`, and maps one ordinary fully-composed `Route` into the underlying
`IRouterBuilder`. The router never sees a group; there is no per-request prefix matching, no group
node in the match path, and a grouped route costs exactly what a directly-mapped route costs at
request time.

**Why raw-text re-parse, not segment-list splicing.** The alternative — parsing prefix and child
separately and concatenating their `RoutePatternPathSegment` lists via `RoutePatternFactory` — would
bypass the parser's cross-segment validation (duplicate parameter names, catch-all-must-be- last,
separator rules), forcing the group to re-implement those rules and inevitably drift from the
parser. Re-parsing the joined text makes the parser's existing semantics *the* conflict rules for
composition: a parameter name duplicated between prefix and child (`{id}` + `{id:int}`), a
catch-all prefix followed by child segments (`files/{*path}` + `download`), or malformed syntax all
throw `RoutePatternException` exactly as they would for a hand-written template. The cost is one
extra parse per registered child — builder-time only, and negligible.

Prefixes are templates, not strings-with-slashes: `{tenant}/api` is a valid group prefix and its
parameters capture route values like any other. Inputs are normalized (leading `~/` or `/` and
trailing `/` trimmed) so `MapGroup("/api/")` + `Map(GET, "/orders/")` composes cleanly to
`api/orders`. An **empty child template** maps the prefix itself (`GET /api/v1`); an **empty
prefix** creates a pure configuration group that only shares policies/metadata.

### Precedence falls out of composition

Because the prefix segments are part of the composed `RoutePattern`,
`RoutePrecedence.ComputeInbound` scores the full path — a literal contributed through a group
outranks a parameter at the same depth regardless of which was registered first or whether either
came from a group. No group-aware code exists in `Router` or `RoutePrecedence`.

### Deterministic sharing: snapshot at creation, freeze at first child

A group's shared state is a **snapshot**: a nested group copies its parent's policy map
(`RouteParameterPolicyMap`'s copy constructor) and metadata list at creation, so siblings and
parents stay isolated. A root group starts from `RouteParameterPolicyMap.CreateDefault()`.

Shared configuration is declared first, children second — enforced, not conventional: once a group
registers its first child route **or** nested group, its shared configuration **freezes** and later
`WithMetadata` /`WithParameterPolicy` calls throw `InvalidOperationException`. This is the
deliberate divergence from ASP.NET's `RouteGroupBuilder`, which defers convention application to
endpoint-build time so late-added conventions still reach earlier children. Deferral needs a
build-time flush hook and mutable pending state on the builder; the freeze rule gets the same
guarantee — *shared values apply to every child* — with immediate composition, immutable routes, and
an order-independent result. The failure mode it prevents is silent: without it, metadata added
after the third of five children would apply to only the last two.

### Override rules (child over group, always)

- **Metadata:** each child's `IRouterRouteMetadataCollection` is built by concatenation — outer
  group items, then inner group items, then route-level items. The bag's last-wins
  `GetMetadata<T>` therefore resolves the most specific declaration, and `GetOrderedMetadata<T>`
  exposes the full broad-to-narrow layering (this is precisely the composition the #150 design
  anticipated). Routes with no metadata at any level share `RouterRouteMetadataCollection.Empty`.
  Groups add no metadata types of their own: shared items are the same **sealed concrete
  carriers** the bag always holds (see "Metadata items are sealed carriers"), so built-ins compose
  through groups with their documented semantics — e.g. a group-level
  `RouteHostMetadata` host-constrains every child, and a child-level `RouteHostMetadata`
  *replaces* (never merges with) the group's, because the router resolves that carrier last-wins.
- **Parameter policies:** `WithParameterPolicy` registers by inline name into the group's map;
  registering a name again (a built-in's, or an outer group's) replaces it for this group's
  children — dictionary-assignment semantics, deterministic. A single route can override the
  group by passing a configure action to the full `Map` overload, which acts on a *copy* of the
  group map scoped to that route only. Unknown policy references in a composed template still
  fail at `Route` construction (builder time), never at request time.

## Pipeline integration (`UseRouting`)

The `UseRouting` middleware resolves the `IRouterFeature`, calls `router.Match(context)` once, and
dispatches on the result:

- **`Matched`** — → store the match on the context (`SetRouteMatch`) and invoke the handler
  (terminal; downstream middleware does not run).
- **`MethodNotAllowed`** — → set `405` and the `Allow` header, then **short-circuit** (do not fall
  through to the terminal 404 pipeline).
- **`NoMatch`** — → call `next`, letting the rest of the pipeline (and any terminal 404) handle it.

`IRouter.RouteAsync` performs the same dispatch for callers that use the router directly without the
middleware, so a direct `RouteAsync` also produces a correct 405 with `Allow`.

### Per-application router state (the isolation rule) (#789)

**Routing state is per application, never process-wide.** Each web application owns exactly one
`IRouterFeature` (the `internal RouterFeature`), which holds that application's `IRouterBuilder`
and the immutable `IRouter` lazily built from it. The wiring guarantees a single builder per app:

- **`AddRouting()`** — (builder time) registers the per-application `RouterFeature` as an `IHttpFeature`.
  Because it is one DI singleton per application, two applications get two distinct features.
- **`UseRouting()`** — (pipeline time) resolves that **same** feature off the application context
  (`builder.Context.Features`) and returns its `Builder`. `MapGet`/`Map` (in `Web.Api`) resolve the
  same feature the same way. So `AddRouting`, `UseRouting`, and `MapGet` all map into and match
  against one per-application builder. `UseRouting` throws if `AddRouting` was not called first.
- **At request time the** — middleware resolves the router from the per-request feature collection
  (`context.Features.Get<IRouterFeature>()`), which is seeded from the application's features — the
  same instance whose `Builder` was mapped into.

This replaces the original defect: `UseRouting()` returned a process-wide
`static RouterBuilder.Shared` while `AddRouting()` registered a *different* per-app builder. Routes
mapped through `UseRouting()` therefore landed in a static that every application in the process
shared — breaking Cohesion's multi-service in-process hosting, where several `WebApplication` s must
keep isolated route tables. The static is deleted; there is no shared builder anywhere in the
library. `PerApplicationRouterStateTests` proves two applications in one process serve only their
own routes.

## Parameter policies (constraints)

Inline constraints (`{id:int}`, `{id:range(1,10)}`, `{id:regex(...)}`, required-value, …) are
resolved through a `RouteParameterPolicyMap` and evaluated **inside** `TryMatchPath`. A failed
constraint means the path did not match *for that route*, so a more general route can still pick the
request up (e.g. `/api/{id:int}` rejects `/api/abc`, which then falls through to `/api/{id}`).
Unknown policy references fail fast at `Route` construction, not at request time.

Policies constrain a value **when one is present** — they do not make the value required. An omitted
optional (or catch-all) parameter captures no value, so its policies are skipped:
`/api/items/{id:int?}` matches `/api/items` (no `id` captured) and `/api/items/7` (typed `int`),
but still rejects `/api/items/abc`. This mirrors the outbound direction, where the link generator
skips policy validation for parameters whose segments collapse.

### The constraint model: validators vs. typed conversions (#789)

`RouteParameterPolicy` is the public extension point. The concrete built-ins are `internal sealed`
(under `Internal/Policies/`) and are surfaced **only by name** through `RouteParameterPolicyMap` —
consumers never reference them as types, which keeps the public policy surface to the two base
classes plus `RouteParameterPolicyContext` and `RouteParameterPolicyMap`. There are two kinds:

- **Validators** derive from `RouteParameterPolicy` and only accept/reject the raw text; the value
  stays a `string`. Built-ins: `alpha`, `length(n)` / `length(min,max)`, `minlength(n)`,
  `maxlength(n)`, `min(n)`, `max(n)`, `range(min,max)`, `regex(...)`, `when(key=value)`.
- **Typed conversions** derive from `TypedRouteParameterPolicy`, which both validates **and**
  converts. Built-ins: `int`, `long`, `decimal`, `double`, `float`, `bool`, `guid`, `datetime`.

The typed-conversion contract is the crux of the #789 fix. Previously a type constraint was just a
regex (`int` == `^-?\d+$`): it *validated* the shape but the matched value stayed a string, so
every binding layer above had to re-parse it — and the regex accepted values the CLR type could not
hold (e.g. an `int` that overflows `Int32`). Now:

- **`TypedRouteParameterPolicy.Applies`** — is **sealed** and owns a single-parse / write-back protocol:
  it parses the raw text **once** (always with `CultureInfo.InvariantCulture`) via the derived
  type's `TryConvert`, and on success calls `context.SetParameterValue(typed)` to replace the string
  in the `RouteValueDictionary` with the strongly-typed value. On failure the candidate is rejected.
- **So after a successful** — match, `values["id"]` for `/{id:int}` is a boxed `int`, not `"42"`.
  Consumers (results, binding, auth) read the typed value with no second parse. This is what
  "constraints produce typed route values" means.
- **Because conversion happens in** — place on the shared `RouteValueDictionary`, a later validator on the
  same parameter (e.g. `{id:int:min(1)}`) sees the already-typed value; validators read it back
  through `Convert.ToString(value, InvariantCulture)`, so order (`int:min` vs `min:int`) does not
  matter.

**Custom typed conversion.** A custom constraint contributes typed conversion the same way the
built-ins do: derive from `TypedRouteParameterPolicy`, implement `ConversionType` + `TryConvert`,
and register it through a `RouteParameterPolicyMap` (`map.Add("version", _ => new …Policy())`). No
reflection or `TypeConverter` is involved, keeping the path AOT-safe.

Values that are already the target type (a typed default, or a re-evaluated candidate) are accepted
without re-parsing (`ConversionType.IsInstanceOfType`), so conversion is genuinely once-per-value.

## Named routes and outbound URL generation (#787)

### Intent

Link generation is the inverse of matching: from a route (addressed by name or by values) and a set
of route values back to a URL. Without it, `Location` headers, HATEOAS links, and redirect targets
are hand-built strings that silently drift from the route table. The generator makes the route table
the single source of truth in **both** directions — and `OutboundPrecedence`, computed since the
pattern model landed, finally has a consumer.

### Names are metadata, not a route property

A route is named by adding a `RouteNameMetadata` item to its endpoint metadata — not by a
constructor parameter or a mutable `Name` property. The alternatives were rejected deliberately:

- **A constructor parameter would** — multiply the already-wide `Route` constructor surface and would
  not compose: a route group (#786) could not contribute or override a name after the fact.
- **Metadata composes for free** — Groups concatenate metadata into a new collection, and
  `GetMetadata<T>()` is last-wins, so an endpoint-level name overrides a group-level one with no
  additional machinery. Naming rides the same #150 seam every other per-endpoint policy rides.

`RouteNameMetadata` follows the family rule for bag items ("Metadata items are sealed carriers, not
interface-per-concept" above): it is **one sealed concrete carrier in `Metadata/`, and the sealed
type is the contract** — there is deliberately no `IRouteNameMetadata` interface. The link generator
keys `GetMetadata<RouteNameMetadata>()` on the carrier directly, and the sealed type guarantees the
validated, immutable name its build-time index snapshots.

### Uniqueness fails at build time

`Route` names are **unique per router, compared case-insensitively**. The name index is built inside
`RouterLinkGenerator`, which the `Router` constructor creates eagerly — so a duplicate name (or a
named route that exposes no pattern) throws `InvalidOperationException` when the route table is
built (`RouterBuilder.Build()` / `Router` construction), never at request time. Per-application
isolation (#789) scopes uniqueness naturally: two applications in one process can both have a route
named `user`.

### The `ILinkGenerator` surface

`ILinkGenerator` is exposed as `IRouter.LinkGenerator` (the router owns the route table; the
generator is its outbound view) and, at request time, through
`HttpContextRoutingExtensions.GetLinkGenerator()`, which resolves the per-application
`IRouterFeature`. Two addressing modes:

- **By name** (`TryGetPathByName` / `GetPathByName` / `…UriByName`) — the name resolves exactly one
  route; generation succeeds or fails on that route alone.
- **By values** (`TryGetPathByValues` / `TryGetUriByValues`) — every pattern-based route whose
  parameters, required values, and policies the supplied values can satisfy is a candidate.
  Candidates are evaluated in **descending `OutboundPrecedence`** order (for generation, *higher*
  is more specific: literals 5 … unconstrained catch-all 1 — the mirror image of the inbound
  table), with **registration order breaking ties** so selection is a deterministic total order.
  The first candidate that generates wins; a candidate that fails (missing parameter, violated
  constraint) falls through to the next.

Absolute URIs are composed from an explicit `HttpScheme` (`Http`/`Https` only) and `HttpHost` — the
generator never guesses an authority from ambient state.

### Generation semantics

`For` a chosen pattern, each parameter resolves to the **supplied value first, the pattern default
second**; a parameter with neither must be optional or a catch-all, and its segment **collapses**. A
collapsed segment must only be followed by collapsed segments — a hole in the middle of a path fails
generation rather than producing a wrong URL. Inside a multi-part segment, a trailing optional with
no value drops together with its preceding separator (`{name}.{ext?}` → `report`), which mirrors
how the matcher treats the omitted form.

Two symmetry rules make generated URLs canonical and round-trippable:

- **Trailing defaults trim.** A trailing run of segments whose values equal their defaults is
  removed (`{controller=Home}/{action=Index}` with `{controller=Store}` → `/Store`; all-default →
  `/`). Matching re-applies the defaults, so generate→match restores the same values.
- **Policies re-validate on generation** (with a null `HttpContext`, which the policy contract
  explicitly permits — validators and typed conversions never touch it). A URL is only generated
  from a route it would inbound-match; `/api/{id:int}` refuses to generate for `id=abc`, and in
  by-values mode the failure falls through to a less specific candidate such as `/api/{id}`.

### Encoding (path vs query)

Parameter values are percent-encoded **per path segment** (`Uri.EscapeDataString`); literals are
authored template text and pass through untouched. Catch-alls follow the two-form rule: `{*path}`
treats the whole value as one segment and encodes `/` as `%2F`; `{**path}` keeps `/` as segment
separators and encodes each piece. The transports deliberately never decode `%2F` (`UrlDecoder`
skips it, as Kestrel does, so an encoded slash cannot fabricate a segment boundary) — which means
`{**path}` is the identity-round-trip form for slash-containing values, while `{*path}` keeps an
embedded slash opaque end-to-end.

Supplied values that are not template parameters append as a **query string** in supplied order (the
`RouteValueDictionary` preserves insertion order), with both keys and values query-encoded. Null
surplus values are skipped.

### `IRouterRoute.Pattern`

Outbound generation needs the parsed pattern, so `IRouterRoute` now exposes `RoutePattern? Pattern`
. It is nullable by design: a fully custom matcher without a pattern is legal, is skipped by the
generator, and cannot carry a route name (addressing a route that cannot be generated is a
configuration error and throws at build time). This was chosen over type-testing for the concrete
`Route` inside the generator, which would have silently dropped wrapped/decorated routes (the shape
#786 groups may produce) out of link generation.

## AOT posture

- **No reflection, no runtime** — code generation, no dynamic activation anywhere in the match path or the
  metadata seam — the library is `IsAotCompatible` and trim-safe.
- **Parameter policies are explicit** — objects resolved through a map, not reflected constructors.
- **Endpoint-metadata discovery (`GetMetadata<T>`, feature** — resolution) is `is`-test / `OfType` based, so
  it is safe for #796 (source-generated binding) to emit metadata objects at build time and for #790
  (auth) to read them at request time under NativeAOT and trimming.
- **Typed conversion (`{id:int}` →** — boxed `int`) is done by parsing built-in BCL `TryParse` methods
  under the invariant culture — no reflection, no `TypeConverter`, no runtime code generation — so it
  is AOT/trim-safe. Custom conversions plug in the same way (`TypedRouteParameterPolicy`).
- **Link generation is equally reflection-free** — values are stringified with
  `Convert.ToString(…, InvariantCulture)`, encoded with `Uri.EscapeDataString`, and policies are
  re-validated through the same explicit policy objects the matcher resolves by name.
- **Source-generated endpoint **binding** (turning** — a matched route into typed handler arguments) is
  intentionally out of scope here and is delivered by the analyzer work in #796; the matcher produces a
  `RouteValueDictionary` whose type-constrained values are already typed and lets that layer bind the rest.

## Lifecycle and immutability

- **`RoutePattern`, `Route`, and `IRouterRouteMetadataCollection`** — are immutable once constructed.
- **`Router`** — snapshots its routes into an immutable list and precomputes the precedence-ordered
  evaluation array in its constructor. A router instance is therefore safe to share across
  concurrent requests; there is no per-request mutable router state.
- **`RouteMatch`** — is an immutable value; the only mutable per-request outputs are the
  `RouteValueDictionary` and the installed `IRouteMatchFeature`.
- **Metadata construction throws `ArgumentException`** — on a `null` item so a malformed metadata list fails
  at the producer, not at a later consumer.

## Family relationships / fan-out

The endpoint-metadata seam (#150) is consumed by:

- **`Route` groups (`MapGroup`, delivered here — #786)** — compose group metadata into each child route
  by concatenating into a new `RouterRouteMetadataCollection` (last-wins makes endpoint-level
  override group-level). See the route-groups section above.
- **#788 Host-based matching** — delivered here: `RouteHostMetadata` rides the bag and the matcher
  consults it during candidate selection (see the host-constrained matching section).
- **#790 Auth scheme model / handlers** — read authorization metadata off the matched endpoint via
  `GetEndpointMetadata<T>()`.
- **#796 Source-generated binding** — emits metadata objects at build time instead of reflecting over
  handler signatures at runtime, and binds the typed route values this library now produces.

## Delivered here

- **#789 Typed route values, expanded constraints, per-application router state** — see the constraint
  model and per-application router state sections above. The additive routing items #786/#787/#788
  build on the route model and match feature here and were intentionally held until #789 merged.
- **#786 `Route` groups (`MapGroup`)** — builder-time prefix/policy/metadata composition; see the
  route-groups section above.
- **#788 Host-based route matching** — see the host-constrained matching section above:
  `RouteHostConstraint` (parsed value object), `RouteHostMetadata` (the sealed
  endpoint-metadata carrier), and the router's host-aware candidate selection and ordering.
- **#787 Named routes + link generation** — see the outbound URL generation section above.
  `OutboundPrecedence` is live code now; route names ride the #150 metadata seam and duplicate
  names fail when the route table is built.

## Non-goals (delivered elsewhere in the routing epic #28)

- **Request-host validation (allowlist → 400)** — the host-filtering middleware, #781. Host
  constraints here *select* routes; they never reject a request.
- **Source-generated binding + validation** — #796.
- **Result writers / content negotiation** — #149.
- **A separate `IEndpoint`/`Endpoint` type** — the matched route is the endpoint. Named routes
  (#787) did not require one — a name is metadata, and the generator addresses routes directly —
  so it remains un-introduced.
- **Ambient-value link generation** — the generator takes explicit values only; it does not reach
  into the current request's matched values to fill gaps. Explicitness keeps generation
  deterministic and testable; a request-aware convenience can layer on top later if the API
  programming models need it.

## Standards

- **RFC 3986** — URI path syntax (segment splitting, percent-encoding expectations); §3.2.2
  host case-insensitivity and bracketed IPv6 literal form.
- **RFC 9110** — HTTP semantics: §9.3.2 (HEAD as GET), §15.5.6 (405 + `Allow`), §4.2.3
  (case-insensitive host comparison), method case-sensitivity.
