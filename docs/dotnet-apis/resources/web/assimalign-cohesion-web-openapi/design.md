# Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.OpenApi design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.OpenApi`.

> **Status:** Partial.

## Design intent

Serve an OpenAPI description of a Cohesion Web application that is generated from the metadata its
endpoints already carry, never from runtime reflection, so the same document is produced under
NativeAOT. The package is the Web adapter the OpenApi family was built to receive (#152): it
implements `IOpenApiEndpointSource` from `OpenApi.Integration` over the application's route table,
lets the integration's description provider and `OpenApiDocumentGenerator` assemble the document,
and serves it from a route.

Three inputs feed it, all produced elsewhere at build or composition time:

- **Web.Api's endpoint descriptions.** The endpoint-binding source generator attaches an
  `EndpointParameterMetadata` per request input and `EndpointResponseMetadata` per response to every
  typed endpoint (#1059). They carry `typeof(...)` values, not reflected shapes.
- **The application's System.Text.Json contracts.** The `JsonTypeInfo` the registered JSON writer
  serializes a type with comes from the application's source-generated `JsonSerializerContext`;
  `JsonSchemaExporter` turns it into JSON Schema.
- **Policy metadata on the routes.** Tags, summaries, descriptions and exclusion from the Web.Api
  description verbs; security requirements from each route's effective authorization policy, which
  Web.Authorization computes from the route's `AuthorizationMetadata` and the application's
  registered `AuthorizationOptions`.

## Family position

The package composes Web feature libraries with the OpenApi family. Arrows mean "references".

| Package | Role here |
| --- | --- |
| `Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Api` | Endpoint descriptions (parameters, responses) and the description verbs (`WithTags`, `WithSummary`, `WithDescription`, `ExcludeFromDescription`) |
| `Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Routing` | The route table (`IRouterFeature.Router`), route patterns, route names, the convention-builder contract |
| `Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Serialization` | The registered readers and writers, and `TryGetJsonTypeInfo`, the read-only seam to the JSON writer's contracts |
| `Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Authorization` / `.Authentication` | The registered `AuthorizationOptions` and each route's effective policy (`TryGetAuthorizationOptions`, `GetEffectivePolicy`) for security requirements; the default authenticate scheme |
| `Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.ProblemDetails` | The RFC 9457 type the binding failures are written as |
| `Assimalign.Cohesion.Http.Forms` | The uploaded-file types (`IHttpFormFile`, `IHttpFormFileCollection`) a file parameter's declared type is matched against; an `App.Web` member, so an `Sdk.Web` application ships no extra assembly for it |
| `Assimalign.Cohesion.OpenApi.Integration` | `IOpenApiEndpointSource`, the description provider, the JSON/YAML exporter |
| `Assimalign.Cohesion.OpenApi.Attributes` / `OpenApi` | The intermediate metadata records and the document model |

The package is a Web feature library under the hosting-isolation rule: it references neither
`Web.Hosting` nor any `Hosting*` library (`COHRES001`, `COHRES004`), and `Web.Hosting` does not
reference it. The OpenApi family never learns that Web exists; the dependency points one way,
adapter to both.

## Packaging: a NuGet package, not an `App.Web` member

`Web.OpenApi` ships as its own package and is **not** listed in the `App.Web` shared framework
(`resources/Web/Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Runtime/Directory.Build.props`, which records it under its
exclusions). An application that serves a document references the package; one that does not
carries none of the OpenApi family (the model, serialization with its YAML engine, validation,
versioning, generation), which is about a dozen assemblies an `Sdk.Web` application would otherwise
ship and, under NativeAOT, compile. That is how ASP.NET Core ships its OpenAPI support
(`Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi` is a package, not part of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App`).

*Rejected: framework membership.* Making the adapter a member would force the whole OpenApi family
into `App.Web`'s closure for every application, documented or not. Nothing in the framework needs
the adapter, and the parts endpoints use to describe themselves are already framework members: the
description carriers and verbs live in `Web.Api` (see below), so a library that maps endpoints can
describe them without depending on this package.

A consequence of the package graph: `OpenApi.Attributes` carries the OpenApi attribute source
generator, so an application that references this package also gets that generator in its
compilation. The generated registry is not composed into the Web document automatically;
`OpenApiOptions.AddEndpointSource` composes it when wanted.

## Which routes are described

A route is described when it has a pattern, names at least one HTTP method with an OpenAPI operation
field, carries no `ExcludeFromDescriptionMetadata`, and is described by someone:

- **the source generator described it** (`EndpointParameterMetadata` or `EndpointResponseMetadata`),
  which every typed endpoint carries; or
- **the application described it** (`EndpointTagsMetadata`, `EndpointSummaryMetadata`,
  `EndpointDescriptionMetadata`, or an `EndpointResponseMetadata` of its own).

A raw middleware endpoint (`MapGet(pattern, WebApplicationMiddleware)`) that nobody described stays
out: nothing records its inputs or outputs, and infrastructure routes (the static-file fallback, the
document route itself) are of that kind. Describing it with any verb brings it in, with its path
parameters typed from the template's constraints and a bare `200`. This mirrors ASP.NET Core, whose
API explorer skips plain `RequestDelegate` endpoints.

A route that accepts any method names no operation and is skipped. `CONNECT` and extension methods
have no operation field and are skipped. `QUERY` becomes the 3.2 `query` operation, which generation
drops for earlier lines. The first route registered for a path and method keeps it: routes whose
templates differ only in constraints (`{id:int}` beside `{id}`) or host share one OpenAPI path.

## How each element is derived

| OpenAPI element | Source | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Path | `IRouterRoute.Pattern` | Literal and separator text as authored; each parameter as `{name}`; constraints, defaults, `?` and catch-all stars dropped (OpenAPI path templating) |
| Operation | `IRouterRoute.Methods` | One per method; `HEAD` only when mapped explicitly (`GET` routes answer it implicitly) |
| `operationId` | `RouteNameMetadata` (`WithName`) | The route name; suffixed `_{method}` when a named route maps several methods |
| `summary`, `description` | `EndpointSummaryMetadata`, `EndpointDescriptionMetadata` | Last wins: a route's replaces its group's |
| `tags` | `EndpointTagsMetadata` | Every item, group first, names listed once; the document's tags are the declared ones (`OpenApiOptions.AddTag`) followed by the undeclared names endpoints use |
| Path parameters | Template parameters | Every template parameter, required (OpenAPI path parameters always are); schema from the handler's declared type when it binds the value (`Route`, or `RouteOrQuery` the template names), otherwise from the inline type constraint (`int`, `long`, `guid`, …), then refined by bounding constraints (`min`, `max`, `range`, `length`, `minlength`, `maxlength`, `alpha`, `regex`) and the template default |
| Query and header parameters | `EndpointParameterMetadata` | `Query`, and `RouteOrQuery` the template does not name, are query parameters; `Header` is a header parameter, except `Accept`, `Content-Type` and `Authorization`, which the OpenAPI Parameter Object says to ignore; `required` is `IsRequired` |
| Parameter schemas | Declared CLR type | A fixed table, not JSON contracts, because the thunk parses these with `IParsable<T>` under the invariant culture: integers and floats with their registry format, `bool`, `string`, `Guid` (`uuid`), dates and times (`date-time`, `date`, `time`), `Uri`, `char`; an enum as a string enum of its names (`Enum.TryParse` accepts them); any other `IParsable<T>` as a string |
| Request body | `EndpointParameterMetadata` (`Body`) | Required; media type of the first registered reader that can read the type (registration order is server preference); schema from the JSON contract |
| Form body | `EndpointParameterMetadata` (`Form`, `FormFile`) | An object with one property per field and file, `required` listing the required ones; `multipart/form-data` when the endpoint uploads a file, otherwise `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. A field's schema comes from the parameter-schema table; a file is `type: string, format: binary`, and a file sequence or an `IHttpFormFileCollection` an array of them (see "Uploaded files") |
| Responses | `EndpointResponseMetadata` | One per status, the last item for a status winning (group, generated, then the endpoint's own); description the RFC 9110 reason phrase; no type means no content; a fixed media type as given (`text/plain` strings get `type: string`); a negotiated value under the media type of the first registered writer that can write it |
| Binding outcomes | The thunk's failure semantics | Added unless the endpoint describes the status: `400` problem+json when the endpoint binds any input, `413` problem+json when it reads a form field or file (a form over an Http.Forms limit), `415` problem+json when it reads a body, a bodyless `406` when it writes a negotiated value; a `200` when nothing else is described |
| Schemas | JSON contracts | See "Schemas from System.Text.Json contracts" |
| Security | The effective authorization policy: `AuthorizationMetadata` against the registered `AuthorizationOptions` | See "Security requirements" |
| Security schemes | `OpenApiOptions.AddSecurityScheme` | As declared |

The binding outcomes are the ones Web.Api's design leaves to "an adapter … by policy": they are what
the generated thunk actually answers, so a client generated from the document knows the error body
shape.

### Uploaded files

A file can only travel in a `multipart/form-data` body (RFC 7578), so an endpoint that binds one is
described with that media type, its form fields as sibling parts. A file part is `type: string` with
the registry format `binary` on every OpenAPI line. That is the form OpenAPI 3.0 defines for an
`application/octet-stream` part. In 3.1 and 3.2, JSON Schema treats `format` as an annotation, but
the format registry keeps `binary` and client generators read it as a file there too. A per-line
schema (`contentMediaType` on 3.1 and later) would be more literal and less widely understood.

The declared type decides the shape. An `IHttpFormFile` is one part, required unless the parameter is
nullable. A file sequence (`IHttpFormFile[]`, `IReadOnlyList<IHttpFormFile>`, …) is an optional array
of parts sent under one field name. An `IHttpFormFileCollection` takes every uploaded file whatever
its field name, which a schema cannot express without giving clients a name to use, so it is
described as an optional array part named for the handler parameter: a name the server accepts, as
it accepts any.

## Schemas from System.Text.Json contracts

A body or response schema is the JSON Schema of the `JsonTypeInfo` the application's JSON writer
serializes the type with, obtained through `TryGetJsonTypeInfo` and exported by `JsonSchemaExporter`.
The exporter reads contract metadata the source-generated context already holds, so no member is
reflected over; property names, nullability, required members, enum converters, number handling and
polymorphism are exactly what the writer uses. `TreatNullObliviousAsNonNullable` makes a root, item,
or non-nullable property non-null; nullable annotations (`Customer?`) make it nullable.

The exporter inlines everything and writes a repeated or recursive shape as a JSON pointer relative
to its own root. A document needs named components instead, so the generator rewrites each node
through the exporter's transform hook as it is produced, children before their parent:

- **Object types become components.** A POCO or record (`JsonTypeInfoKind.Object`) becomes
  `{"$ref": "#/components/schemas/Name"}` at its usage, and its body is exported once, separately, as
  the component. A nullable usage is `anyOf` of the reference and `{"type": "null"}`. Recursion
  therefore resolves to a component reference.
- **Pointers to collections are re-exported inline.** A pointer the exporter wrote for a repeated
  collection or dictionary would point into a schema that is about to be split, so the type is
  exported again in place. A collection that contains itself stops at an unconstrained schema.
- **Polymorphic branches stay inline.** Each derived type in a polymorphic base's `anyOf` is a
  partial schema completed by the base's keywords (`type`, the discriminator in `required`), so the
  base is the component and the branches stay with it. A derived type used directly is a component
  of its own.
- **Numbers are described as written.** The web defaults read numbers from strings
  (`JsonNumberHandling.AllowReadingFromString`), which the exporter states as `["string", "integer"]`
  plus a pattern. The writer emits JSON numbers, so the description drops the string alternative and
  the pattern, unless the contract writes numbers as strings, and adds the registry format (`int32`,
  `int64`, `double`, `decimal`, …). `byte[]` gains `format: byte` (base64), and a string enum
  without a type gains `type: string`.

**What the contract states is what the writer guarantees.** The exporter lists a property as
`required` when the contract requires it (`required` members, `[JsonRequired]`) and also every
constructor parameter without a default value, and it marks a property non-nullable from its
annotations. The writer always honors both, so response schemas are exact. The reader enforces them
only when the application opts in (`RespectRequiredConstructorParameters` and
`RespectNullableAnnotations`, both off in the web defaults): a request body that omits a positional
record's parameter, or sends `null` for a non-nullable property, is still accepted. The description
is then stricter than the reader, which is safe for clients; an application that wants the two to
agree sets both options in the `AddJsonSerialization` callback. The adapter does not second-guess the
contract.

Component names are the type name, `Page<Order>` as `PageOfOrder` and `Order[]` as `OrderArray`,
reduced to `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`, with a numeric suffix when two different types share a name. They are
allocated in the order the route table first meets the types, so they are stable from build to
build. `ProblemDetails` (Web.ProblemDetails' RFC 9457 type) is never exported from a contract: it
has no serialization attributes and the problem writer emits it by hand, so it maps to a fixed
RFC 9457 component with the five standard members.

The converter from the exporter's JSON Schema to the model handles the version differences the model
cannot: a nullable reference is `allOf: [{ $ref }]` with `nullable: true` for 3.0, which has no
`null` type; `const` becomes a one-value `enum` for 3.0; and a type list with several non-null
entries keeps one for 3.0. Everything else (type arrays and `nullable`, boolean schemas, the 3.1
vocabulary) the model's writer already adapts per line. Only the keywords the exporter emits are
mapped.

## Why the metadata carries complete schemas

`IOpenApiEndpointSource` speaks the flat intermediate metadata of `OpenApi.Attributes`: parameters
with a scalar type and format, bodies and responses with a component reference, components with flat
scalar properties. That vocabulary cannot say "an array of `Order`", a dictionary, an enum, a
nullable reference, or a nested inline object, which is most of what a JSON contract describes.

The adapter therefore uses one addition to the OpenApi family: an optional `Schema` member on
`OpenApiParameterMetadata`, `OpenApiRequestBodyMetadata`, `OpenApiResponseMetadata` and
`OpenApiSchemaMetadata`. When it is set, `OpenApiDocumentGenerator` places that model schema as it
is instead of building one from the flat fields. The attribute mapper and the source generator never
set it, so their output is unchanged; a producer that already holds a complete schema passes it
through.

*Rejected: compose the schemas after generation.* The adapter could leave `Schemas` empty, let the
provider generate a document with bare references, and then patch components and media-type schemas
into the model. That splits document assembly across two packages, contradicts the Integration
design ("This project — not Web — knows how to turn that metadata into a document"), and leaves the
contract's `Schemas` member meaningless for its first real implementation.

*Rejected: flatten the exporter's output.* Mapping JSON Schema onto the flat records loses arrays,
dictionaries, enums and nullability. The document would be valid and wrong.

*Rejected: a second, richer source contract.* A separate `IOpenApiSchemaSource` would duplicate the
provider's composition for one producer, where four optional members do the same job.

## The Web.Serialization seam

The adapter needs the very contracts the JSON writer serializes with, or property names (camelCase
by default), nullability and converters drift from the wire. `Web.Serialization` keeps its options
internal, so it gained one public extension member,
`bool IHttpContentSerializationFeature.TryGetJsonTypeInfo(Type type, out JsonTypeInfo? typeInfo)`.

It resolves the writer the registry selects for `application/json` and, when that is the built-in
JSON writer, returns its contract for the type. The options and the writer stay internal and
read-only.

*Rejected: take the `JsonSerializerContext` again.* `AddOpenApi(AppJsonContext.Default)` would let
the two registrations drift apart, and the context alone does not carry the options (`AddJson`'s web
defaults and the application's `configure` callback), so names and number handling could differ
from the wire.

*Rejected: expose the options, or an interface on the writer.* Handing out `JsonSerializerOptions`
(even frozen) widens the seam to everything the options touch; a public interface for the internal
writer adds a type for one consumer. The extension answers exactly the question a describer asks.

## The Web.Authorization seam

Web.Authorization keeps its registration internal, so it gained a read-only seam for describers
(#1205):

- **`bool IWebApplicationContext.TryGetAuthorizationOptions(out AuthorizationOptions? options)`** —
  the options `AddAuthorization` registered, which are read-only, resolved the way
  `UseAuthorization` resolves them.
- **`bool AuthorizationOptions.TryGetPolicy(string name, out AuthorizationPolicy? policy)`** — a
  named policy; this member was internal before.
- **`AuthorizationPolicy? AuthorizationOptions.GetEffectivePolicy(IRouterRouteMetadataCollection metadata)`**
  — the middleware's own combination, moved onto the options so that the middleware and this adapter
  run the same code; the middleware keeps only its per-endpoint cache.

The adapter needs only the accessor and `GetEffectivePolicy`. Web.Authorization's design ("Reading
the options back") records why the seam has this shape.

Unlike the Web.Serialization seam, this one hands out the options: they hold policies, the very thing
a describer reads, and they are already immutable once registered, so there is no wider surface
behind them to protect.

*Rejected: `InternalsVisibleTo`.* The repository forbids grants between shipped libraries.

*Rejected: interpret the metadata here.* The first version of the adapter mirrored the
`AllowAnonymous` rule itself and could not see the options, so the fallback policy, named policies'
schemes and a reconfigured default policy were invisible: an endpoint protected only by the fallback
policy was documented as open. Two copies of a security rule drift; one shared computation cannot.

## The description verbs live in Web.Api

`WithTags`, `WithSummary`, `WithDescription` and `ExcludeFromDescription`, and their sealed carriers,
ship in `Web.Api` beside the generated parameter and response descriptions, as generic
`extension<TBuilder>(TBuilder builder) where TBuilder : IRouterConventionBuilder` members that work on
routes and groups alike. Web.Api is a framework member and is format-neutral, so any library that
maps endpoints can describe them without referencing this NuGet-only package or the OpenApi family.

*Rejected: verbs in Web.OpenApi.* Describing an endpoint would then require the document generator
and everything under it; a reusable endpoint library would push the OpenApi family onto every
consumer.

## The document endpoint

`AddOpenApi(options => ...)` captures the options as a typed application feature; they are read-only
once the callback returns, and a second call replaces the first registration.
`MapOpenApi(pattern = "/openapi/v1.json")` maps a `GET` route through Web.Api's raw `Map` and returns
its `IRouterRouteBuilder`, so the document route can carry policies (`RequireAuthorization`,
`RequireCors`). The route is itself marked `ExcludeFromDescription`.

- **Format.** A pattern ending in `.yaml` or `.yml` serves YAML as `application/yaml` (RFC 9512), any
  other JSON as `application/json; charset=utf-8`. YAML is offered because `OpenApi.Serialization`
  already writes it through `Content.Yaml`, and some tools prefer it; it costs a format switch.
- **Line.** The options' `SpecVersion` (default 3.1), or the one `MapOpenApi(pattern, specVersion)`
  names, so a 3.0 rendition can sit beside the 3.1 default for tools that do not read 3.1.
- **Built once.** The route table is closed when the application starts. The endpoint builds and
  serializes its document on the first request and serves those bytes afterwards. A failed build is
  not cached: the exception (an `InvalidOperationException` naming the endpoint that could not be
  described) reaches the pipeline's exception boundary, and the next request tries again.
- **Revalidation.** The representation carries a strong `ETag`, the SHA-256 of its bytes, and
  `If-None-Match`/`If-Match` are evaluated with the `Http` conditional-request primitive
  (RFC 9110 §13.2.2): a current client gets `304` with no body. `HEAD` gets the `GET` header section.

A route-table read happens only when a document is built, never at `MapOpenApi`: reading the router
builds it and closes the table, which must not happen while the application is still mapping.

`GetOpenApiDescriptionProvider()` on the application returns the same document as an
`IOpenApiDescriptionProvider`, for tools and tests that want the model. Each call builds a new
document, because the model is mutable and a shared instance would let one caller change what
another sees. `OpenApiOptions.AddDocumentTransformer` edits each built document for what metadata
does not carry (servers, contact, license, extensions); `AddEndpointSource` composes another source
after the routes.

## Security requirements

The adapter does not interpret authorization metadata itself. For each described route it asks
Web.Authorization for the effective policy (`GetEffectivePolicy`, see "The Web.Authorization seam"),
the computation `UseAuthorization` runs: every item applies, outer group first; the most specific
`AllowAnonymous` clears the items declared before it; a named policy resolves against the registered
ones; an item that names no policy and no roles gets the default policy; and a route without items
gets the fallback policy. Then:

1. **No effective policy means no security requirement:** the route's last authorization item is
   `AllowAnonymous`, or it has no items and the application has no fallback policy.
2. **The schemes are the policy's `AuthenticationSchemes`:** the union, in order, of the schemes of
   every policy that contributed (named, inline, default or fallback) and of the items' own.
3. **With none named,** the policy evaluates `context.User`, which the default authenticate scheme
   establishes, so that scheme is used (`IAuthenticationService.DefaultAuthenticateScheme`); without
   a default, every declared scheme.
4. **Each scheme the document declares** (`OpenApiOptions.AddSecurityScheme`, matched by name)
   becomes one requirement object with no scopes, the objects being alternatives as the policy's
   schemes are.

With `Bearer` as the default authenticate scheme and a `partners` policy that selects `ApiKey`:

| Route | Described |
| --- | --- |
| no authorization metadata, no fallback policy | open |
| no authorization metadata, `FallbackPolicy = DefaultPolicy` | `Bearer` |
| `RequireAuthorization("partners")` | `ApiKey` only |
| `RequireAuthorization()` with a default policy that selects `ApiKey` | `ApiKey` only |
| group `RequireAuthorization("partners")`, route `AllowAnonymous()` | open |
| group `AllowAnonymous()`, route `RequireAuthorization("partners")` | `ApiKey` |

**An application without `AddAuthorization`** is described with the defaults `AddAuthorization()`
would register: no fallback policy, so a route without items is open, and `RequireAuthorization()`
means an authenticated user through the default authenticate scheme. A route that declares a
requirement is therefore never described as open, even though, with no middleware to authorize it, it
fails at dispatch instead of running.

**An unregistered policy name** fails the document with an `InvalidOperationException` that names
the endpoint and the policy, as a type without a serializer does: the same error fails every request
to the endpoint, and describing it as open, or as protected through a guessed scheme, would be wrong
either way. The policy is resolved whether or not the document declares security schemes, so the
failure does not depend on the document's options.

Limits:

- **Roles are not written into the scope arrays.** OAS 3.0 requires them empty for non-OAuth
  schemes, and Web.Authorization's roles mean "any of", where a requirement's array means "all of".
- **No OAuth2 flows.** `OpenApiSecuritySchemeMetadata` has no OAuth2 flows, so an OAuth2 scheme needs
  a document transformer; OpenID Connect, HTTP and API-key schemes are declared directly.
- **Undeclared schemes are left out.** A scheme an endpoint uses but the document does not declare
  cannot be referenced.
- **Unmatched requests.** The fallback policy also covers requests no route matches, which have no
  operation to describe.
- **The document describes the registered policies, not the pipeline.** An application that sets a
  fallback policy but never registers `UseAuthorization` serves its unannotated endpoints
  unauthorized (Web.Authorization's design, "Fail closed", explains why nothing catches that), while
  the document lists the fallback policy's requirement.
- **Open operations carry no `security` field.** An open operation is written without a `security`
  field rather than as `security: []`, because the OpenApi model does not distinguish the two; the
  adapter declares no document-wide requirement, so they mean the same, but a transformer that adds
  one makes every open operation inherit it.

## Error model

Composition errors are `InvalidOperationException`, as elsewhere in the Web area: `MapOpenApi` or
`GetOpenApiDescriptionProvider` without `AddOpenApi`, a document built without `AddRouting`, and an
endpoint that cannot be described. The last names the endpoint (`GET /orders/{id}`) and the type, and
says to add it to the application's `JsonSerializerContext`; it is raised when a body or result type
has no registered reader or writer, which is the same composition error that faults the endpoint
itself at run time. It is raised the same way, with Web.Authorization's message naming the policy,
when an endpoint's authorization names a policy that is not registered. Options mutators throw
`InvalidOperationException` once read-only, and argument validation throws the usual
`ArgumentException` family.

## AOT posture

`IsAotCompatible` (inherited), with no trim or AOT analyzer warnings. The schema path is
`JsonSchemaExporter` over source-generated `JsonTypeInfo`; parameter schemas come from a fixed type
table and `Enum.GetNames(Type)`; type names come from `Type.Name` and `Type.GetGenericArguments()`,
which need no reflection metadata beyond the type itself. JSON nodes are built with non-generic
`JsonNode` members only (the generic `JsonArray.Add<T>` is `RequiresDynamicCode`). Security
requirements come from Web.Authorization's `GetEffectivePolicy`, which reads endpoint metadata with
`is` tests and policies that are plain objects. The document is serialized by
`OpenApi.Serialization`'s explicit writers.

Evidence beyond the analyzers: a `PublishAot` probe application (typed endpoints over route, query
and body inputs, a nullable reference, a recursive type, collections, dictionaries, string and
numeric enums, an authorized endpoint) published for `win-arm64` with ILC's per-assembly trim/AOT
summaries (`IL2104`, `IL3053`) as errors, and the native binary served the 3.0, 3.1 and 3.2
documents, the YAML rendition and the `304` over real HTTP (2026-10-01). In CI the Web NativeAOT
guard (`resources/Web/Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Hosting/samples/Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.AotGuard`) is
where an OpenAPI endpoint is exercised under `PublishAot`.

## Non-goals

- **Runtime reflection over handlers or CLR types.** The description comes from metadata the source
  generator and the serialization contracts already hold.
- **XML comments as descriptions.** They are not in the compiled metadata; `WithSummary` and
  `WithDescription` carry text explicitly.
- **Multiple media types per body or status.** The intermediate metadata carries one media type per
  request body and per response status, so a negotiated response lists the default writer's type and
  a form body of fields alone lists `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` (the form reader also accepts
  `multipart/form-data`). A form that uploads a file lists `multipart/form-data`, the only encoding
  that can carry one.
- **Antiforgery and CORS in the description.** Neither has an OpenAPI representation beyond a
  parameter the application can declare itself.
- **Discriminator objects, examples, and `x-` extensions from contracts.** The exporter does not
  produce them; a document transformer can add them.
- **Several documents per application.** One document per application, rendered per line and
  format; grouping endpoints into separate documents is a later feature.

## Extending

- **A new `EndpointParameterSource`** is skipped as undescribed until this adapter maps it, which
  Web.Api asks of every consumer. `FormFile` (#1061) is the precedent: it joined `Form` in the request
  body ("Uploaded files" above) and added the form's `413` outcome.
- **A new description carrier** belongs in `Web.Api` with its verb, and counts toward "described" in
  `WebOpenApiEndpointSource.IsDescribed`.
- **A non-JSON format's schemas** would need a seam like `TryGetJsonTypeInfo` on that format's
  writer; today a type only a non-JSON writer covers gets its media type with no schema.
