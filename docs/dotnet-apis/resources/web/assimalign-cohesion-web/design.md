# Assimalign.Cohesion.Web design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.Web`.

> **Status:** Partial.

## Design intent

`Assimalign.Cohesion.Web` is the Web area root: the composition seams every Web library builds
against — the application/builder contracts (`IWebApplication`, `IWebApplicationBuilder`,
`IWebApplicationContext`), the middleware-first pipeline (`IWebApplicationPipeline`,
`IWebApplicationPipelineBuilder`, `IWebApplicationMiddleware`, the `WebApplicationMiddleware`
delegate), and the server seam (`IWebApplicationServer`). Feature packages compose against these;
the runtime module (`Web.Hosting`) implements them; the build-enforced hosting-isolation rule
(`resources/Web/README.md`, `.claude/rules/resource-areas.md`) keeps the two directions from ever
meeting in a library's dependency graph.

The root is deliberately **contracts-only**. Features — their models, options, builder verbs, and
middleware — live in per-concern `Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.<Feature>` packages, never here
(precedent: authentication's model and builder surface live in `Web.Authentication`;
forwarded-headers resolution lives in `Web.ForwardedHeaders`). The separation is what it protects:
the root stays small and stable so every feature library can reference it without inheriting anyone
else's surface, and a feature's dependency cost is always opt-in. The breakdown signal — this file's
reason to exist — is the root absorbing anything feature- or model-specific; that is an architecture
conversation, not a convenience call.

The root references `Assimalign.Cohesion.Http` and no `Assimalign.Cohesion.Hosting*` library (O34).
`IWebApplication` exposes `Context`, `StartAsync`, and `StopAsync`; `IWebApplicationBuilder`
supplies Web registration verbs and `Build()`. Background-work registration belongs to the concrete
`WebApplicationBuilder` in `Web.Hosting`. DI, configuration, and logging integration remain
builder-time hosting concerns.

## The pipeline model (middleware-first)

The Web area composes request handling as an onion of middleware over `IHttpContext` — fluent
`.Use(...)` registration, `Task InvokeAsync(IHttpContext, WebApplicationMiddleware next)` execution,
registration order = execution order. There is deliberately no return-value result model (the
`IResult` abstraction was withdrawn pre-merge, 2026-07-10 direction): middleware either writes the
response and stops calling `next`, or cooperates by attaching typed features to
`IHttpContext.Features` for downstream stages. That feature-collection seam — not request-time
service location — is the area's extensibility mechanism, which is why the pipeline contracts here
stay this small.

`WebApplicationExtensions` carries the one piece of sugar the root owns: the inline
`Use(Func<IHttpContext, WebApplicationMiddleware, Task>)` adapter that bridges application lambdas
onto the core `Use(Func<WebApplicationMiddleware, WebApplicationMiddleware>)` registration form.

## `Application` lifecycle services

The concrete `WebApplicationBuilder.AddService` in `Web.Hosting` accepts an `IHostService` instance
or a factory over the final concrete `WebApplicationContext`. The factory runs once at build time.
The root builder has no service-registration member or hosting-library reference; no area-owned
service abstraction is introduced (O34).

`Application` services and Web servers form two ordered phases rather than one interleaved list:
services start first in service-registration order, then servers start in server-registration order.
Host shutdown reverses the full sequence, so every server drains before application services stop.
This ordering holds regardless of whether an `AddService` call appeared before or after an
`AddServer` call in the fluent composition.

## Server lifecycle contract

`IWebResponseCompletionFeature` is the response-transmission seam beside `IWebApplicationServer`.
The default server installs it on every exchange and invokes callbacks in registration order after
writing the response to the transport. Registration after completion throws
`InvalidOperationException`. Custom servers may omit it; middleware must handle a missing feature.
This lets a terminal defer lifecycle signals until its acknowledgement has been sent.

`IWebApplicationServer.StartAsync` is the endpoint-acquisition boundary: it does not complete until
every listener is bound and ready to accept. Binding failures propagate through startup instead of
surfacing later from an accept loop. `StopAsync` is the symmetric release boundary and does not
complete until the endpoints are released. Hosted restart constructs a fresh server/listener
instance after the prior instance stops; a disposed listener is not rebound.

`IWebApplicationBuilder.AddServer` accepts that contracts-only server directly or through a factory
over the final `IWebApplicationContext`. The Hosting implementation supplies its own lifecycle
adapter, so a server is not required to reference or implement Hosting's `IHostService`. Multiple
servers start in registration order and stop in reverse order; `IWebApplicationContext.Servers`
exposes the original server objects rather than their runtime adapters.

`AddPipeline` is the complete user-pipeline replacement seam. A Hosting runtime may still place
fixed runtime terminals ahead of the supplied pipeline; replacing user dispatch does not replace
host-owned lifecycle or management surfaces.

## Ordering is registration order

Middleware ordering is positional. Some features carry hard ordering contracts — for example
`Web.ForwardedHeaders` must be registered before anything that consumes client identity — and each
feature package documents its own. Formal, enforceable ordering rules are the open #26/#145 work;
the root intentionally ships no enforcement mechanism ahead of them.

## AOT posture

Contracts and delegate plumbing only — no reflection, no runtime codegen (`IsAotCompatible=true`).

## Non-goals

- **Feature models or middleware.** Per-concern packages own them; the root absorbing a
  feature is the architecture smell this design guards against.
- **DI/configuration/logging integration.** `Web.Hosting` composes those, builder-time
  only.
- **A return-value result model.** Withdrawn by design; the pipeline is middleware-first.
