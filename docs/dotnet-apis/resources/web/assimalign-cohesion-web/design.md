# Assimalign.Cohesion.Web design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.Web`.

> **Status:** Partial.

## Design intent

`Assimalign.Cohesion.Web` is the Web area root: the composition seams every Web library builds
against — the application/builder contracts (`IWebApplication`, `IWebApplicationBuilder`,
`IWebApplicationContext`), the middleware-first pipeline (`IWebApplicationPipeline`,
`IWebApplicationPipelineBuilder`, `IWebApplicationMiddleware`, the `WebApplicationMiddleware`
delegate), and the server seam (`IWebApplicationServer`). Feature packages compose against these;
the runtime module (`Web.Hosting`) implements them; the build-enforced hosting-isolation rule
(`resources/Web/README.md`, `.claude/rules/resource-areas.md`) keeps the two directions from ever
meeting in a library's dependency graph.

The root is deliberately **contracts-only**. Features — their models, options, builder verbs, and
middleware — live in per-concern `Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.<Feature>` packages, never here
(precedent: authentication's model and builder surface live in `Web.Authentication`;
forwarded-headers resolution lives in `Web.ForwardedHeaders`). The separation is what it protects:
the root stays small and stable so every feature library can reference it without inheriting anyone
else's surface, and a feature's dependency cost is always opt-in. The breakdown signal — this file's
reason to exist — is the root absorbing anything feature- or model-specific; that is an architecture
conversation, not a convenience call.

The root references `Assimalign.Cohesion.Http` and no `Assimalign.Cohesion.Hosting*` library (O34).
`IWebApplication` exposes `Context`, `StartAsync`, and `StopAsync`; `IWebApplicationBuilder`
supplies Web registration verbs and `Build()`. Background-work registration belongs to the concrete
`WebApplicationBuilder` in `Web.Hosting`. DI, configuration, and logging integration remain
builder-time hosting concerns.

## The pipeline model (middleware-first)

The Web area composes request handling as an onion of middleware over `IHttpContext` — fluent
`.Use(...)` registration, `Task InvokeAsync(IHttpContext, WebApplicationMiddleware next)` execution,
registration order = execution order. There is deliberately no return-value result model (the
`IResult` abstraction was withdrawn pre-merge, 2026-07-10 direction): middleware either writes the
response and stops calling `next`, or cooperates by attaching typed features to
`IHttpContext.Features` for downstream stages. That feature-collection seam — not request-time
service location — is the area's extensibility mechanism, which is why the pipeline contracts here
stay this small.

`WebApplicationExtensions` carries the one piece of sugar the root owns: the inline
`Use(Func<IHttpContext, WebApplicationMiddleware, Task>)` adapter that bridges application lambdas
onto the core `Use(Func<WebApplicationMiddleware, WebApplicationMiddleware>)` registration form.

That core form is a component factory: the pipeline builder invokes it once, when it builds the
pipeline, and the delegate it returns runs for each request. The factory body is therefore the
composition-time seam for work that must fail at startup rather than on a request, without a
dependency on the hosting runtime: `UseRouting` builds the application's route table there (#1051).

## Endpoint selection and the pipeline terminal (#1054)

Selecting an endpoint and running it are separate pipeline steps. A selecting middleware
(`UseRouting` in `Web.Routing`) publishes an `IWebEndpointFeature` and calls `next`, so every
middleware registered after it runs with the endpoint known. The pipeline's **terminal** (the
innermost delegate a pipeline builder composes, reached when every middleware called `next`) runs
`IWebEndpointFeature.Endpoint` when the feature is present, and otherwise applies the builder's
unhandled-request behavior (`WebApplication`'s bodyless 404).

The feature is a root seam because the terminal belongs to the pipeline builder, which lives in
`Web.Hosting`, and COHRES002 forbids that module from referencing `Web.Routing`. It carries only the
delegate to run. The endpoint's model (its route, values and metadata) stays in the package that
selected it, so the root does not absorb routing. Every `IWebApplicationPipelineBuilder`
implementation must honor the contract at its terminal. That includes test doubles, which is why the
Routing tests' application double runs the published endpoint too.

The terminal itself is the root's `WebApplicationTerminal.InvokeAsync` (#1056): run the published
endpoint, or set a bodyless `404` on an untouched response. `WebApplication` in Web.Hosting and
every non-rejoining branch end in it, so there is one definition of "unhandled".

## Pipeline branching (#1056)

`WebApplicationBranchingExtensions` adds four verbs over `IWebApplicationPipelineBuilder`:

| Verb | Runs the branch when | Rejoins the main pipeline |
|---|---|---|
| `Map(path, branch)` | the path starts with `path` at a segment boundary (case-insensitive) | no; ends in `WebApplicationTerminal` |
| `MapWhen(predicate, branch)` | `predicate(context)` is true | no; ends in `WebApplicationTerminal` |
| `UseWhen(predicate, branch)` | `predicate(context)` is true | yes; the branch's `next` is the rest of the pipeline |
| `Run(terminal)` | always, where registered | no; nothing after it runs |

A branch is collected by an internal `WebApplicationBranchBuilder` and composed by the containing
pipeline when that pipeline is built. Every branch registration is kept in the component-factory
shape that takes the application context, so middleware that needs the context at composition time
(`UseStaticFiles` reads the web root) composes inside a branch exactly as it does on the
application. An endpoint selected before a non-rejoining branch still runs at the branch's terminal.

**`Map(path)` does not rewrite the request.** `IHttpRequest.Path` is read-only on the interface, and
the Web area's model is to publish an effective view rather than mutate the request (owner decision
3, the forwarded-headers model; request mutation is the open #782 gate). A path branch publishes
`IWebPathBaseFeature`: the accumulated `PathBase` (outermost prefix first) and the `Path` below it.
Middleware that can be mounted in a branch reads `context.GetEffectivePath()`, which
`Web.StaticFiles` does. Absolute URLs keep using the full `IHttpRequest.Path`, which also keeps a
redirect such as static files' add-a-slash correct inside a branch. A nested `Map` matches against
the effective path, so prefixes compose. The view is removed when the branch returns.

**Branches hold middleware, not routes.** Routes belong to the application's router (`app.MapGet`,
`app.MapGroup`), and per-endpoint behavior is endpoint metadata. The routing verbs require the
application builder (`TBuilder : IWebApplicationPipelineBuilder, IWebApplication`), so they are not
available on a branch. A sub-path API is a route group; a sub-path asset mount is a `Map` branch.

## `Application` lifecycle services

The concrete `WebApplicationBuilder.AddService` in `Web.Hosting` accepts an `IHostService` instance
or a factory over the final concrete `WebApplicationContext`. The factory runs once at build time.
The root builder has no service-registration member or hosting-library reference; no area-owned
service abstraction is introduced (O34).

`Application` services and Web servers form two ordered phases rather than one interleaved list:
services start first in service-registration order, then servers start in server-registration order.
Host shutdown reverses the full sequence, so every server drains before application services stop.
This ordering holds regardless of whether an `AddService` call appeared before or after an
`AddServer` call in the fluent composition.

## Server lifecycle contract

`IWebResponseCompletionFeature` is the response-transmission seam beside `IWebApplicationServer`.
The default server installs it on every exchange and invokes callbacks in registration order after
writing the response to the transport. Registration after completion throws
`InvalidOperationException`. Custom servers may omit it; middleware must handle a missing feature.
This lets a terminal defer lifecycle signals until its acknowledgement has been sent.

`IWebApplicationServer.StartAsync` is the endpoint-acquisition boundary: it does not complete until
every listener is bound and ready to accept. Binding failures propagate through startup instead of
surfacing later from an accept loop. `StopAsync` is the symmetric release boundary and does not
complete until the endpoints are released. Hosted restart constructs a fresh server/listener
instance after the prior instance stops; a disposed listener is not rebound.

`IWebApplicationBuilder.AddServer` accepts that contracts-only server directly or through a factory
over the final `IWebApplicationContext`. The Hosting implementation supplies its own lifecycle
adapter, so a server is not required to reference or implement Hosting's `IHostService`. Multiple
servers start in registration order and stop in reverse order; `IWebApplicationContext.Servers`
exposes the original server objects rather than their runtime adapters.

`AddPipeline` is the complete user-pipeline replacement seam. A Hosting runtime may still place
fixed runtime terminals ahead of the supplied pipeline; replacing user dispatch does not replace
host-owned lifecycle or management surfaces.

## Ordering is registration order

Middleware ordering is positional. Some features carry hard ordering contracts — for example
`Web.ForwardedHeaders` must be registered before anything that consumes client identity — and each
feature package documents its own. Formal, enforceable ordering rules are the open #26/#145 work;
the root intentionally ships no enforcement mechanism ahead of them.

## AOT posture

Contracts and delegate plumbing only — no reflection, no runtime codegen (`IsAotCompatible=true`).

## Non-goals

- **Feature models or middleware.** Per-concern packages own them; the root absorbing a
  feature is the architecture smell this design guards against.
- **DI/configuration/logging integration.** `Web.Hosting` composes those, builder-time
  only.
- **A return-value result model.** Withdrawn by design; the pipeline is middleware-first.
