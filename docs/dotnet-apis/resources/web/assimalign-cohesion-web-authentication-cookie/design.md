# Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Authentication.Cookie design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Authentication.Cookie`.

> **Status:** Partial.

## Design intent

The cookie authentication scheme: sign a user in by issuing a protected ticket cookie, authenticate
later requests by validating that cookie, and drive the login / logout / access-denied flow. It is
the `IAuthenticationSignInHandler` implementation of the scheme model defined in
`Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Authentication`.

The package is deliberately thin. It owns three things: the ticket's binary shape, the
sliding-expiration policy, and the redirect-vs-status decision. Everything cryptographic is
delegated; everything about scheme dispatch belongs to the base package.

## Why the ticket is protected, never signed by hand

The cookie carries a `ClaimsPrincipal` plus its `AuthenticationProperties` across requests. That
payload must be **confidential and tamper-evident**: a client must not read or forge it. The handler
delegates this entirely to `Assimalign.Cohesion.Security.DataProtection` 's `IDataProtector`
(AES-256-GCM keyed by an HKDF-derived subkey off a rotating key ring). The handler never sees key
bytes, never picks an algorithm, never rolls its own MAC — it calls `Protect` /`Unprotect`.

This mirrors the precedent set when `Http.Antiforgery` was rewired onto a pluggable protector seam
(#774): key material and its lifecycle live in the composition root, and the request-path component
consumes a protector. The protector is supplied on `CookieAuthenticationOptions.TicketProtector` by
this package's grafted `AddCookie` verb (an `extension(AuthenticationBuilder)` member — moved here
from `Web.Hosting` under the Web-area dependency rule), which derives it from the builder's key ring
scoped to a per-scheme purpose chain (`…Cookie` / scheme name / `v1`), so two cookie schemes cannot
read each other's tickets.

`Unprotect` throws `DataProtectionException` for a tampered, foreign, or aged-out payload; the
handler catches it and returns `AuthenticateResult.Fail` rather than letting it escape — a bad
cookie is an expected, normal outcome, not an exception the pipeline should surface.

## Why a hand-rolled binary ticket serializer

`CookieTicketSerializer` writes the principal (identities, claims with type/value/valueType/issuer,
name- and role-claim types) and the properties with `BinaryWriter` /`BinaryReader`. It uses no
reflection and no runtime-typed serializer, so it round-trips under NativeAOT and trimming — the
repo-wide constraint. A version byte guards future format changes. The serialized bytes are only
ever read back *after* `Unprotect` has verified authenticity, so the reader is not parsing hostile
input directly; it still validates counts and the version defensively.

`DateTimeOffset` values are stored as UTC ticks (the offset is irrelevant to the handler's expiry
check), and a null string is distinguished from an empty one with a sentinel so claims round-trip
exactly.

## Expiration and sliding renewal

Two independent clocks govern a ticket:

- **Absolute expiry** — the ticket's `ExpiresUtc` (set on sign-in from
  `ExpireTimeSpan` unless the caller supplied its own). `AuthenticateAsync`
  rejects a ticket whose `ExpiresUtc` is at or before now.
- **Sliding renewal** — when `SlidingExpiration` is on and the request
  arrives past the *midpoint* of the ticket's lifetime, the handler
  re-issues the cookie with a fresh window of the same length. This is the
  ASP.NET Core rule; renewing only past the midpoint avoids writing a
  `Set-Cookie` on every request.

Renewal writes a new `Set-Cookie` during `AuthenticateAsync`. All cookie emission funnels through
one `IssueCookie` path that removes any already-queued cookie of the same name first, so a
renewal-then-sign-out in one request still emits exactly one line for the name.

Time is taken from an injectable `TimeProvider` (`TimeProvider.System` by default) so tests drive
expiry and renewal deterministically.

## Redirect vs. status: keyed on endpoint metadata

`ChallengeAsync` /`ForbidAsync` must behave differently for a browser page and a JSON API sharing
one cookie scheme. The handler resolves the `IApiEndpointMetadata` marker from the matched route's
metadata (the #150 bag surfaced by `Web.Routing` 's `context.GetEndpointMetadata<T>()`,
reflection-free):

- **API endpoint** (marker present) → bare `401` (challenge) / `403`
  (forbid), no `Location`.
- **Otherwise** → `302` redirect to `LoginPath` (with an
  encoded `ReturnUrl`) / `AccessDeniedPath`.

This mirrors the .NET 10 cookie handler's `IApiEndpointMetadata` -keyed decision. The return URL is
the request path; the query string is omitted in v1 (the redirect targets and the parameter name are
configurable).

## Cookie hardening defaults

The emitted cookie defaults to `HttpOnly=true`, `SameSite=Lax`, `Path=/`, and `IsEssential=true`
(see "Under the cookie policy" below). A persistent sign-in (`IsPersistent=true`) emits
`Expires`/`Max-Age`; a non-persistent one emits a session cookie. Sign-out emits a deletion cookie
(empty value, epoch `Expires`, zero `Max-Age`). The underlying `HttpCookie` validates its value
against the RFC 6265 cookie-octet grammar; the protected ticket is base64url-encoded (unpadded),
whose alphabet is a subset of that grammar, so it can never split the `Set-Cookie` line.

### `Secure` — a floor on the effective scheme, not a policy surface

Every cookie the handler emits (issue, sliding renewal, sign-out deletion) is built from the
`Cookie` template and then given one floor: **when the effective request scheme is HTTPS, `Secure`
is set**, whatever the template says. The template's own `Secure = true` still marks the cookie
`Secure` on every request.

"Effective" is `context.EffectiveScheme` from `Assimalign.Cohesion.Http.Forwarded` (owner decision 3
in `docs/programs/HTTP_WEB_PROGRAM_PLAN.md` §7.4: consumers read the effective values; nothing
rewrites the request). A direct TLS connection counts, and so does TLS terminated at a proxy that
`UseForwardedHeaders` trusts. Without the forwarded-headers middleware — or from a peer outside its
trust model — the effective scheme is the transport-derived one, so a client that sends
`X-Forwarded-Proto: https` itself changes nothing. Register `UseForwardedHeaders` ahead of
`UseAuthentication`.

Why a floor and not the options considered with it (#1050, defect D7):

- **Keep the static template (the previous behavior).** `Secure` defaulted to
  `false` and only the template decided. A deployment that served HTTPS and
  forgot `Secure = true` issued the ticket without it, and the browser would
  send the ticket over any later plaintext request to the host. Behind a
  TLS-terminating proxy there was no way to say "Secure when the client used
  HTTPS" at all. Rejected.
- **A tri-state secure policy option** (ASP.NET's `CookieSecurePolicy`:
  `SameAsRequest` / `Always` / `None`) on this handler. That is new public
  surface and a default-choosing decision for every cookie, not just the
  ticket, so it lives in `Web.CookiePolicy` (#156) as `CookiePolicyOptions.Secure`
  rather than here.
- **Chosen: template OR effective HTTPS.** It is a pure hardening with no public
  API change: over HTTPS the cookie can only gain `Secure`, and over plaintext
  the template decides exactly as before. What it removes is the ability to emit
  a non-`Secure` ticket over HTTPS — a credential the browser would then also
  send over plaintext, since only the `Secure` attribute confines a cookie to
  secure channels (RFC 6265bis §4.1.2.5). It composes with `Web.CookiePolicy`
  (#156), whose default `SameAsRequest` reads the same effective scheme, so
  the two never disagree.

### Under the cookie policy (#156)

The handler emits through `response.Cookies`, so when `UseCookiePolicy` runs the policy judges the
ticket, its renewal, and the sign-out deletion like any other cookie. Its consent rule, attribute
floors, and RFC 6265bis requirements apply. What that means for the defaults:

- **The ticket is essential.** `Cookie.IsEssential` defaults to `true`. That was the one gap #156
  found: before the policy existed nothing read `IsEssential`, so the template never set it, and
  under a consent requirement a non-essential ticket would be dropped on every request; a user could
  never stay signed in. Signing in is something the user asked for, which is what "essential" means.
  An application that collects consent before it offers sign-in can set it to `false`.
- **`Secure` behind a proxy** is the handler's floor above plus the policy's `SameAsRequest`; both
  read the effective scheme.
- **`SameSite`** stays `Lax` unless `MinimumSameSitePolicy` raises it. `Strict` withholds the ticket
  from top-level navigations that arrive from another site, so a user following a link in is treated
  as signed out on that first request.
- **A `__Host-` ticket name** works: the template's `Path=/` and absent `Domain`, plus the `Secure`
  floor over HTTPS, satisfy the prefix. Over plaintext the policy's `Upgrade` adds `Secure`, which
  only a `localhost` client accepts, and `Reject` drops the ticket.
- **Sign-out always passes:** the deletion cookie is a deletion, which consent never blocks.

The handler takes no reference to `Web.CookiePolicy`; the two meet only in the cookie model.

### Redirects and the return URL need no host or scheme

The challenge and forbid redirects emit a relative `Location` — the configured path plus
`ReturnUrl=<request path>` — which the user agent resolves against the URL it actually requested.
Nothing in the handler reads `Request.Host`, `Request.Scheme`, or the connection for them, so they
are correct behind a proxy by construction; an absolute return URL would have to be built from the
effective scheme and host.

## Interface-first posture

`CookieAuthenticationHandler` is `internal`; the public surface is `IAuthenticationHandler`
/`IAuthenticationSignInHandler` from the base package plus the `CookieAuthentication.CreateHandler`
factory the composition root calls. `CookieAuthenticationOptions` and `CookieAuthenticationDefaults`
are the only other public types.

## AOT posture

`<IsAotCompatible>true</IsAotCompatible>` is inherited. No reflection, no runtime code generation:
the serializer is hand-written, the protector is BCL AEAD, base64url is
`System.Buffers.Text.Base64Url`, and endpoint metadata resolution is an `is` -test scan.

## Non-goals

- **OAuth2 / OIDC interactive login.** Redirect-based external sign-in is a
  follow-up; this handler only manages a first-party session cookie.
- **Cookie policy (consent, same-site overrides).** Cross-cutting cookie
  policy is `Web.CookiePolicy`'s concern; the handler only marks its ticket
  essential (see "Under the cookie policy").
- **`Key` management.** The rotating key ring and its persistence live in
  `Security.DataProtection`, carried at builder time by
  `AuthenticationBuilder.DataProtectionProvider` (the default key ring, or
  a provider the application passes to `AuthenticationBuilder.UseDataProtection`
  inside `builder.Services.AddAuthentication`).
