# Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Authentication.Cookie design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Authentication.Cookie`.

> **Status:** Partial.

## Design intent

The cookie authentication scheme: sign a user in by issuing a protected ticket cookie, authenticate
later requests by validating that cookie, and drive the login / logout / access-denied flow. It is
the `IAuthenticationSignInHandler` implementation of the scheme model defined in
`Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Authentication`.

The package is deliberately thin. It owns three things: the ticket's binary shape, the
sliding-expiration policy, and the redirect-vs-status decision. Everything cryptographic is
delegated; everything about scheme dispatch belongs to the base package.

## Why the ticket is protected, never signed by hand

The cookie carries a `ClaimsPrincipal` plus its `AuthenticationProperties` across requests. That
payload must be **confidential and tamper-evident**: a client must not read or forge it. The handler
delegates this entirely to `Assimalign.Cohesion.Security.DataProtection` 's `IDataProtector`
(AES-256-GCM keyed by an HKDF-derived subkey off a rotating key ring). The handler never sees key
bytes, never picks an algorithm, never rolls its own MAC — it calls `Protect` /`Unprotect`.

This mirrors the precedent set when `Http.Antiforgery` was rewired onto a pluggable protector seam
(#774): key material and its lifecycle live in the composition root, and the request-path component
consumes a protector. The protector is supplied on `CookieAuthenticationOptions.TicketProtector` by
this package's grafted `AddCookie` verb (an `extension(AuthenticationBuilder)` member — moved here
from `Web.Hosting` under the Web-area dependency rule), which derives it from the builder's key ring
scoped to a per-scheme purpose chain (`…Cookie` / scheme name / `v1`), so two cookie schemes cannot
read each other's tickets.

`Unprotect` throws `DataProtectionException` for a tampered, foreign, or aged-out payload; the
handler catches it and returns `AuthenticateResult.Fail` rather than letting it escape — a bad
cookie is an expected, normal outcome, not an exception the pipeline should surface.

## Why a hand-rolled binary ticket serializer

`CookieTicketSerializer` writes the principal (identities, claims with type/value/valueType/issuer,
name- and role-claim types) and the properties with `BinaryWriter` /`BinaryReader`. It uses no
reflection and no runtime-typed serializer, so it round-trips under NativeAOT and trimming — the
repo-wide constraint. A version byte guards future format changes. The serialized bytes are only
ever read back *after* `Unprotect` has verified authenticity, so the reader is not parsing hostile
input directly; it still validates counts and the version defensively.

`DateTimeOffset` values are stored as UTC ticks (the offset is irrelevant to the handler's expiry
check), and a null string is distinguished from an empty one with a sentinel so claims round-trip
exactly.

## Expiration and sliding renewal

Two independent clocks govern a ticket:

- **Absolute expiry** — the ticket's `ExpiresUtc` (set on sign-in from
  `ExpireTimeSpan` unless the caller supplied its own). `AuthenticateAsync`
  rejects a ticket whose `ExpiresUtc` is at or before now.
- **Sliding renewal** — when `SlidingExpiration` is on and the request
  arrives past the *midpoint* of the ticket's lifetime, the handler
  re-issues the cookie with a fresh window of the same length. This is the
  ASP.NET Core rule; renewing only past the midpoint avoids writing a
  `Set-Cookie` on every request.

Renewal writes a new `Set-Cookie` during `AuthenticateAsync`. All cookie emission funnels through
one `IssueCookie` path that removes any already-queued cookie of the same name first, so a
renewal-then-sign-out in one request still emits exactly one line for the name.

Time is taken from an injectable `TimeProvider` (`TimeProvider.System` by default) so tests drive
expiry and renewal deterministically.

## Redirect vs. status: keyed on endpoint metadata

`ChallengeAsync` /`ForbidAsync` must behave differently for a browser page and a JSON API sharing
one cookie scheme. The handler resolves the `IApiEndpointMetadata` marker from the matched route's
metadata (the #150 bag surfaced by `Web.Routing` 's `context.GetEndpointMetadata<T>()`,
reflection-free):

- **API endpoint** (marker present) → bare `401` (challenge) / `403`
  (forbid), no `Location`.
- **Otherwise** → `302` redirect to `LoginPath` (with an
  encoded `ReturnUrl`) / `AccessDeniedPath`.

This mirrors the .NET 10 cookie handler's `IApiEndpointMetadata` -keyed decision. The return URL is
the request path; the query string is omitted in v1 (the redirect targets and the parameter name are
configurable).

## Cookie hardening defaults

The emitted cookie defaults to `HttpOnly=true`, `SameSite=Lax`, `Path=/`. `Secure` defaults to
`false` because the transport scheme is not modeled as a policy here; production deployments over
HTTPS set `Secure=true`. A persistent sign-in (`IsPersistent=true`) emits `Expires` /`Max-Age`; a
non-persistent one emits a session cookie. Sign-out emits a deletion cookie (empty value, epoch
`Expires`, zero `Max-Age`). The underlying `HttpCookie` validates its value against the RFC 6265
cookie-octet grammar; the protected ticket is base64url-encoded (unpadded), whose alphabet is a
subset of that grammar, so it can never split the `Set-Cookie` line.

## Interface-first posture

`CookieAuthenticationHandler` is `internal`; the public surface is `IAuthenticationHandler`
/`IAuthenticationSignInHandler` from the base package plus the `CookieAuthentication.CreateHandler`
factory the composition root calls. `CookieAuthenticationOptions` and `CookieAuthenticationDefaults`
are the only other public types.

## AOT posture

`<IsAotCompatible>true</IsAotCompatible>` is inherited. No reflection, no runtime code generation:
the serializer is hand-written, the protector is BCL AEAD, base64url is
`System.Buffers.Text.Base64Url`, and endpoint metadata resolution is an `is` -test scan.

## Non-goals

- **OAuth2 / OIDC interactive login.** Redirect-based external sign-in is a
  follow-up; this handler only manages a first-party session cookie.
- **Cookie policy (consent, same-site overrides).** Cross-cutting cookie
  policy is `Web.CookiePolicy`'s concern.
- **`Key` management.** The rotating key ring and its persistence live in
  `Security.DataProtection`, carried at builder time by
  `AuthenticationBuilder.DataProtectionProvider` (the default key ring, or
  a provider the application passes to `AddAuthentication`).
