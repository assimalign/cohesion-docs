HTTP request/response logging and W3C access logs for Cohesion web applications, in one diagnostics
package:

- **`UseHttpLogging`** — an `IWebApplicationMiddleware` that captures request/response metadata
  for each exchange and emits one structured `LoggerEntry` through the application's Cohesion
  logging pipeline when the downstream pipeline completes (or faults).
- **`W3CAccessLogProvider`** — an `ILoggerProvider` that renders those entries as W3C Extended
  or NCSA common/combined access-log files with buffered, size- and day-rolled output.

Emission deliberately **rides the repo's own Logging model** — providers, enrichers, and filter
rules all apply — rather than a parallel logging pipeline. The two halves meet at the stable
attribute-name contract in `HttpLoggingAttributes` (`http.request.method`, `http.response.status`,
`http.duration`, ...), so any provider, filter, or enricher can consume access-log entries without
referencing this package's middleware.

## Composition

See the [source-backed usage examples](examples/index.md).

`Register` `UseHttpLogging` **first** — ahead of authentication, CORS, and routing — so rejected
exchanges are logged too.

## Field selection and redaction

`HttpLoggingFields` selects what is captured. The default set carries the request line, headers,
status, duration, client address, byte counts, and trace correlation; the **query string and bodies
are opt-in** because they routinely carry secrets. `Header` redaction is **allowlist-based**: names
always log, values log only for allowlisted headers, and `Authorization`, `Proxy-Authorization`,
`Cookie`, and `Set-Cookie` are never in the default allowlists.

Per-endpoint overrides attach an `HttpLoggingMetadata` to the route's metadata bag (last-wins);
`HttpLoggingFields.None` silences an endpoint entirely — the usual choice for health probes.

## Dependencies

| Reference | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `Assimalign.Cohesion.Web` | the middleware/pipeline abstractions |
| `Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Routing` | reads the endpoint metadata bag for per-endpoint overrides |
| `Assimalign.Cohesion.Logging` | the emission model (`ILogger`, `LoggerEntry`, `LoggerProvider`) |

See [DESIGN.md](design.md) for the architecture and the decisions behind it.
