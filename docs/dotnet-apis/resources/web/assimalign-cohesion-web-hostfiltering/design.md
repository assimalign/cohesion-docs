# Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.HostFiltering design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.HostFiltering`.

> **Status:** Partial.

## Design intent

Allowed-hosts enforcement (issue #781): a defense against Host-header injection (cache poisoning,
password-reset poisoning, absolute-URL generation against an attacker-chosen host), which matters
here because a Cohesion web application is designed to be directly exposed by its own server, not
assumed to sit behind a validating proxy.

The package is deliberately thin: the *matching* primitives — the `host[:port]` component split on
`HttpHost` and the precompiled allowlist matcher `HttpHostMatcher` — live in
`Assimalign.Cohesion.Http` (see its `docs/DESIGN.md`, "Host values and allowlist matching"),
because they are typed protocol value logic every consumer must agree on. This package owns only the
Web-pipeline surface: the options object, the `UseHostFiltering` verb, and the internal middleware.

## Why a feature package, not hosting-injected middleware

The first iteration of #781 placed the enforcement inside `Web.Hosting` (builder options + a
first-position wrapper injected at pipeline build), on the reading that a host guard is server
policy. The owner redirected this (2026-07-16): host filtering is a **feature library** like every
other pipeline concern, and `Web.Hosting` must not carry feature knowledge — the same
hosting-isolation pressure that moved the authentication builder verbs out of hosting, and the same
shape `Web.ForwardedHeaders` shipped with ("every feature, including foundational middleware, ships
as its own `Web.<Feature>` package with its verb"). The issue's original "no standalone
Web.HostFiltering project" note is superseded by that direction.

The consequence is the composition model changing from *hosting-guaranteed* first position to a
**registration-order contract**: `UseHostFiltering` is documented (and tested) as *register it at
the front*; the area's [middleware order](../../../../web/middleware-order.md) gives its exact place.
This follows the Web area's middleware-first direction — the application owns its pipeline order —
and it resolves the forwarded-headers ordering question by putting the decision where it belongs
(see below). What was kept from the first iteration:

- **Builder-time compilation.** The allowlist compiles into an
  `HttpHostMatcher` exactly once, inside the `UseHostFiltering` call. Invalid
  patterns throw `ArgumentException` at registration — configuration errors
  surface at startup, never as per-request behavior. Registration is
  dependency-free per the Web-area rule: no service container, no
  configuration binding, no request-time service location.
- **Explicit opt-in.** Not calling the verb means no filtering (the pre-#781
  behavior, zero overhead). Calling it demands a non-empty allowlist — an
  empty one would compile to deny-all and is treated as a configuration error;
  pass `*` to accept any host while keeping the empty-host policy enforced.
- **The request-time check.** The transports already resolve the wire host
  with the correct per-version precedence (HTTP/1.1 absolute/authority-form
  target supersedes `Host` per RFC 9112 §3.2.2; HTTP/2 / HTTP/3 `:authority`
  via `HttpFieldNormalization.ResolveAuthority`), and the forwarded-headers
  middleware publishes a proxy-forwarded host as a typed value too. The
  middleware reads the effective host (`context.EffectiveHost`, see "Validating
  the forwarded host" below) and performs one feature lookup, one component
  split, and span comparisons. A mismatch answers `400 Bad Request` with an
  empty body (the HTTP/1.1 writer synthesizes `Content-Length: 0`) and
  short-circuits; the connection itself is left alive.

**Why the 400 has no body:** a richer problem-details payload would drag a `Web.ProblemDetails`
dependency into a guard that should stay minimal; rejected-request bodies are an application
error-handling concern (the #864 `OnError` direction), not this package's.

**Empty/missing host policy (RFC 9112 §3.2).** An HTTP/1.1 request that lacks a `Host` header (and
carries no target authority) resolves to `HttpHost.Empty` and cannot be validated, so it is rejected
by default. `AllowEmptyHost = true` is the explicit opt-out for legacy HTTP/1.0-style clients; it
admits only the *hostless* case — a present-but-unmatched host is still rejected.

## Validation, not selection — composing with #788

Host filtering **validates** the request ("is this host one of mine?"); routing's host constraints
(#788, `RequireHost` / `RouteHostMetadata`) **select** among endpoints ("which route serves this
host?"). They are complementary, not duplicates: both consume the same `HttpHost` component
semantics from the Http core (bracket-insensitive IPv6, case-insensitive, apex-excluded `*.`
wildcards), so a given wire value means the same thing on both paths — but a filtering mismatch is a
400, while a routing host mismatch merely skips a route candidate. `Use` filtering to bound the hosts
the application answers *at all*, and host-constrained routes to fan traffic across the hosts inside
that boundary.

One asymmetry is known and recorded: behind a proxy that forwards a host, filtering validates the
*effective* host (below) while routing's host constraints still match the *wire* host
(`Router.Match` reads `IHttpRequest.Host`). The two agree whenever the proxy passes the client's
`Host` through; when it rewrites `Host` and forwards the original in `X-Forwarded-Host`,
host-constrained routes see the upstream authority. Moving routing onto the effective host is left
to the routing rework (Stage 6 of the HTTP/Web program), not changed here.

## Validating the forwarded host (`Web.ForwardedHeaders`, #778; #1050)

The forwarded-headers middleware's output is **a feature, never mutation**: its trust walk publishes
`IHttpForwardedFeature` and never rewrites `IHttpRequest.Host`. Consumers read the result through
the `Effective*` convention in `Http.Forwarded` (owner decision 3 in
`docs/programs/HTTP_WEB_PROGRAM_PLAN.md` §7.4). This guard is one of those consumers: **it validates
`context.EffectiveHost`**, which is

- the host a trusted proxy forwarded, when `UseForwardedHeaders` ran first and
  accepted a hop that carried one, and
- the transport-resolved wire host otherwise — no forwarded-headers
  middleware, an untrusted peer, a hop that forwarded no host, or a
  registration that puts this guard ahead of `UseForwardedHeaders`.

**Why the effective host.** The forwarded walk shape-checks `host` assertions but leaves *which*
hosts are acceptable to a consumer allowlist. The effective host is the one every downstream
consumer reads — HTTPS redirection's `Location`, absolute-URL generation, output-cache keys — so it
is the value Host-header injection would poison and the value the allowlist must bound. Validating
only the wire host behind a proxy would check the authority the proxy dialed (usually a fixed
internal name) while an attacker-influenced forwarded host flowed downstream unchecked. The earlier
position — "forwarded host out of scope, a future knob" — was replaced by this default rather than a
knob: without the forwarded-headers middleware the effective host *is* the wire host, so no
proxy-less deployment sees a change.

**Trust dependency.** The guard never reads `Forwarded`/`X-Forwarded-Host` itself. A forwarded host
reaches it only through the forwarded-headers trust model (`KnownProxies`/`KnownNetworks`,
`ForwardLimit`, header selection), so a client that asserts `X-Forwarded-Host` directly is validated
on its wire host. The trust model decides *whose* host assertion is believed; this guard decides
whether the believed host is one the application serves.

**Ordering.** Register `UseHostFiltering` directly after `UseForwardedHeaders` (only
`UseHttpLogging` and `UseSecurityHeaders`, which read no client identity, go ahead of both; the
[middleware order](../../../../web/middleware-order.md) gives the full sequence), and allowlist the
**public** names clients use. Registered the other way round, the guard runs before
the feature exists and validates the wire host — a supported, deliberate configuration for
deployments that want to bound the upstream authority instead, but then the forwarded host is not
bounded by this guard. This composition differs from ASP.NET, whose forwarded-headers middleware
rewrites `Request.Host` in place (so host filtering registered after it validates the forwarded host
implicitly) and which also offers a separate forwarded-host allowlist
(`ForwardedHeadersOptions.AllowedHosts`); here the rewrite is replaced by the effective read, and
the one allowlist covers both cases.

## AOT posture

Options → precompiled matcher at registration; request-time span comparisons only. No reflection, no
configuration binding, no service location.

## Non-goals

- **No hosting integration.** The package must not (and cannot, per the
  build-enforced hosting-isolation rule) be referenced by `Web.Hosting`;
  front-of-pipeline placement is the application's registration-order
  responsibility, not a hosting guarantee.
- **No port-aware allowlisting** — host validation is host-identity; which
  ports are served is a listener/binding concern.
- **No response body on rejection** — see above; applications own error
  payloads.
- **No per-route filtering** — bounding *which* hosts an endpoint serves is
  routing's `RequireHost`, not an allowlist concern.

## Testing

`tests/HostFilteringTests.cs` drives the middleware end to end through
`Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.Testing` 's factory: allow/deny over origin-form HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2
`:authority`, registration-order short-circuiting, case-insensitivity, request-port ignoring,
wildcard depth/apex/lookalikes, IPv6 literals, the `*` pattern, and registration-time failure for
invalid or empty allowlists. Raw HTTP/1.1 exchanges over the in-memory transport cover what
`HttpClient` cannot produce: a missing `Host` header (the empty-host policy both ways) and
absolute-form request-targets superseding the `Host` header (RFC 9112 §3.2.2). The pattern grammar
itself is unit-tested with the matcher in `Assimalign.Cohesion.Http`.

`tests/HostFilteringForwardedTests.cs` composes the real forwarded-headers middleware (the test
project references `Web.ForwardedHeaders`) in front of the guard over the same factory, whose
in-memory peer is trusted as a local transport — the simulated proxy. It pins that an allowlisted
forwarded host is accepted even when the wire host is not, that a forwarded host outside the
allowlist is rejected even when the wire host is allowlisted, and that without the forwarded-headers
middleware, or with the guard registered ahead of it, the wire host is validated and forwarding
headers are ignored.
