# Assimalign.Cohesion.Web.HostFiltering

Allowed-hosts enforcement for the Cohesion Web pipeline: a guard against Host-header injection (cache poisoning, password-reset poisoning, absolute-URL generation against an attacker-chosen host).

> **Status:** Partial.

Allowed-hosts enforcement for the Cohesion Web pipeline: a guard against Host-header injection
(cache poisoning, password-reset poisoning, absolute-URL generation against an attacker-chosen
host). It matters because a Cohesion web application is designed to be directly exposed by its own
server, not assumed to sit behind a validating proxy — ASP.NET ships the equivalent (AllowedHosts)
enabled by default.

## What it provides

- **`UseHostFiltering(Action<HostFilteringOptions> configure)`** — a pipeline verb
  on `IWebApplicationPipelineBuilder` that registers the validation middleware.
  **`Register` it first**: registration order is pipeline order, and a request
  whose host fails validation should be rejected before anything else sees it.
- **`HostFilteringOptions`** — the allowlist (`AllowedHosts`) plus the explicit
  RFC 9112 §3.2 empty/missing-Host policy (`AllowEmptyHost`, default
  `false` = reject).

The matching itself is the `Assimalign.Cohesion.Http` host toolkit: `HttpHost.TryGetComponents` (the
`host[:port]` component split) and `HttpHostMatcher` (the precompiled allowlist — exact hosts,
`*.example.com` wildcard subdomains with the apex excluded, `*` match-any). The allowlist compiles
exactly once, inside the `UseHostFiltering` call; invalid patterns and an empty allowlist throw at
registration, never at request time.

## Usage

See the [source-backed usage examples](examples/index.md).

A request whose transport-resolved host (HTTP/1.1 request-target/`Host` precedence, HTTP/2 / HTTP/3
`:authority`) does not match answers `400 Bad Request` with an empty body and short-circuits.

## Dependencies

- **`Assimalign.Cohesion.Web`** — the pipeline abstractions the verb extends.
- **`Assimalign.Cohesion.Http`** — `HttpHost` and `HttpHostMatcher`.

Delivered to applications through the `App.Web` shared framework (via `Sdk.Web`); no project wiring
required. See `docs/DESIGN.md` for the design decisions, the composition with host-based route
matching, and the ordering interaction with forwarded-headers processing.
