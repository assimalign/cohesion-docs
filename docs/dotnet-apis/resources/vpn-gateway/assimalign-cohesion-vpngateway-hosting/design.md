# Assimalign.Cohesion.VpnGateway.Hosting design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.VpnGateway.Hosting`.

> **Status:** Partial.

## Design intent

The hosting module implements the area root's contract-only application seam.
`VpnGatewayApplication.CreateBuilder(args)` returns the public concrete
`VpnGatewayApplicationBuilder`; its `Build()` returns the public
`VpnGatewayApplication : Host<VpnGatewayApplicationContext>`. The public
`VpnGatewayApplicationContext` implements `IVpnGatewayApplicationContext`, reading
`ContentRootPath` from the host environment. The application explicitly forwards the root lifecycle
contract to `IHost`, and consumers use the concrete application for `RunAsync` and `await using`.
Runtime options and supporting services remain internal.

## Composition execution model

Each build creates a new context, invokes every registered service factory exactly once against that
context, and exposes the materialized services as an ordered, read-only `HostedServices` snapshot.
The shared host starts services in registration order and stops them in reverse; an unregistered
resource with an unconfigured builder still produces an empty collection and a production
`HostEnvironment`.

`TunnelDataPlaneService` remains as a dormant future service stub and is not registered by default.

## Boundaries

The module references the area root and Hosting, Hosting.Health, and Hosting.Resources publicly. Its
Web, Web.Hosting, Web.Hosting.Resources, HTTP, and transport implementation dependencies are
private, with their resolved closure supplied by the area runtime framework. Hosting never
references its own ApplicationModel package. It uses no reflection or dynamic activation and remains
trimming- and NativeAOT-safe.

## Enabled resource lifecycle

The builder discovers the entry assembly's registered default control plane through
ResourceRuntime.TryCreateControlPlane. The host environment carries the ambient environment name and
content root. `Build` adds the host health contributor and a private http listener when its ambient
endpoint exists, then calls ResourceRuntime.HostBuilt. `RunAsync` delegates to the base host runner
seam introduced by 3a62edab (design R6). Without registration, the ordinary explicit-service host
remains unchanged and opens no listener.

Web.Hosting.Resources is installed first on the private listener. It serves the exact v1 resource
routes and post-23b command envelopes. Readiness observes the owning area's HostState.Started;
managed namespaced routes verify ES256 bootstrap tokens against ApplicationTrustKey. Standalone
resources work without a gateway identity. No command kinds or handlers are declared; unsupported
commands return 501 with a Rejected body. Domain service stubs remain dormant.

## HTTPS endpoint certificate contract (31t)

The enabled resource's `http` listener consumes the shared Hosting.Resources endpoint certificate
accessor. Endpoint metadata identifies an ordinary Secret mount (default `tls`), carrying one PEM
leaf/private-key/chain document; existing hand-authored IdentityHub and LogSpace bundles retain the
same format. Empty mounts are absent; malformed or multi-key bundles fail. TLS options are composed
in Hosting from the returned leaf and chain, with no hosting-isolation exemptions or dependency
changes. Plain application composition is unchanged.

## Optional telemetry (31b)

The registered resource constructor calls ResourceTelemetry.Configure using the invocation snapshot.
With no gateway or telemetry endpoint, existing providers and hosted services are unchanged. When
enabled, the shared Hosting.Telemetry sibling adds OTLP/HTTP JSON logging and a service registered
before producers; reverse `StopAsync` drains producers before a flush bounded by five seconds and the
host shutdown token. Logging remains composed only in Hosting. See
libraries/Hosting/`Assimalign.Cohesion.Hosting.Telemetry`/docs/DESIGN.md for ordering and protocol
limits.

## Concrete composition (T10 / O34)

Background-work registration belongs to the concrete `VpnGatewayApplicationBuilder`:
`AddService(IHostService)` and `AddService(Func<VpnGatewayApplicationContext, IHostService>)`. The
factory receives the same concrete context as Web's and `Database`'s `AddService`, so hosting consumers
can use environment, state, and hosted-service members beyond the small root contract. Factories run
once per build against the same context retained by the application; the hosted-service snapshot is
installed after factory evaluation. Services start in registration order and stop in reverse. No
area-owned service abstraction is introduced.
