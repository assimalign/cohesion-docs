## Summary

This project defines the public, contract-only builder and application lifecycle seam for the
VpnGateway area. The implementation and creation entry point live in
`Assimalign.Cohesion.VpnGateway.Hosting`.

## Public surface

- **`IVpnGatewayApplicationBuilder`** — owns area declarations and builds an `IVpnGatewayApplication`.
- **`IVpnGatewayApplication`** — exposes `Context`, `StartAsync`, and `StopAsync`.

The current application is a composition-only filler that is empty by default. Caller-registered
services participate in the shared ordered lifecycle; VPN data-plane behavior remains outside this
slice.

## Hosting-free application contract (O34)

The root contracts are hosting-free (O34): `IVpnGatewayApplication` exposes `Context`, `StartAsync`
, and `StopAsync`; `IVpnGatewayApplicationContext` exposes `ContentRootPath`.
`IVpnGatewayApplicationBuilder` exposes `Build()`; it currently declares no area-specific verbs.
The root and feature packages reference no `Assimalign.Cohesion.Hosting*` library; `COHRES004`
enforces the boundary.

`VpnGatewayApplication.CreateBuilder(args)` returns the public concrete
`VpnGatewayApplicationBuilder`; its `Build()` returns the public
`VpnGatewayApplication : Host<VpnGatewayApplicationContext>`. The public
`VpnGatewayApplicationContext` implements `IVpnGatewayApplicationContext`, reading
`ContentRootPath` from the host environment. The application explicitly forwards the root lifecycle
contract to `IHost`, and consumers use the concrete application for `RunAsync` and `await using`.
Runtime options and supporting services remain internal.

Background-work registration (`AddService`) is available only on the concrete Hosting builder.
