# RezolvrResourceCommandExtensions

The `RezolvrResourceCommandExtensions` type belongs to `Assimalign.Cohesion.Rezolvr.ApplicationModel`.

> **Status:** Partial.

`Extension` members on `IRezolvrResourceDescriptor` attach typed commands and return the same
descriptor for fluent chaining. Each method accepts `optional = false`; optional controls gateway
reconciliation behavior, without relaxing payload validation or ownership.

| Wire kind | Descriptor verb | Ownership key |
|---|---|---|
| `rezolvr.add-a-record` | `AddARecord` | record name |
| `rezolvr.add-cname-record` | `AddCnameRecord` | record name |

A-record declarations use a BCL IPv4 IPAddress serialized as a string. CNAME declarations carry a
DNS target string; TTL is a positive integer in seconds, defaulting to 300. `COHAM001` keeps Dns
assemblies outside the ApplicationModel dependency closure.

Hosting stores records atomically in `records.json` under
`ResourceContext.GetMount("data", Path.GetFullPath(Path.Combine(ContentRootPath, "data")))`.
Without a data mount, storage therefore lives in the content-root-derived data directory. No
CohesionMount or CohesionWorkloadKind change is made: GenericPlanner requires StatefulSet for a
Volume while RezolvrPlanner requires Deployment. The command registry survives restart and restores
ownership before the listener starts.

Records are stored, not served as DNS answers. ResolverEndpointService remains parked. DNS serving
and reconciling a durable Volume with the Deployment contract are deferred area work.

Blank required strings, invalid single-segment keys and malformed argument values throw argument
exceptions naming the offending parameter. `Build` rejects unadvertised kinds or duplicate target keys
through ResourceCommandValidator. Serialization uses the internal generated JSON context.
