# Assimalign.Cohesion.Rezolvr.ApplicationModel design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.Rezolvr.ApplicationModel`.

> **Status:** Partial.

`RezolvrResource` wraps a manifest snapshot and typed `RezolvrResourceOptions`, and delegates to its
internal planner. `AddRezolvr` returns `IRezolvrResourceDescriptor`, a thin graph-descriptor wrapper
retaining dependencies and the built plan. The planner validates the kind, Deployment workload,
declared area endpoint schemes/protocols, and admin control plane at /cohesion/v1, then delegates
realization to GenericPlanner. Endpoint ports, extra endpoints, secret/configuration mounts, and
generic deployer options remain manifest-driven; no platform types are referenced.

SDK defaults retain dns udp:53, dns-tcp tcp:53, and admin http/tcp:8081. Only admin hosts the
control plane; the filler does not implement DNS service.

`RezolvrResourceControlPlane.Create` returns a fresh Hosting.Resources control plane accepting the two
record command kinds. Runtime Hosting discovers the generated registration and serves its protocol
through the private Web.Hosting.Resources feature. Unsupported command envelopes are refused with
501.

The package is NuGet-only (developer-experience design D4/O2), never a framework member. Its only
direct dependencies are ApplicationModel and Hosting.Resources; `COHAM001` checks its full resolved
closure. Public resource/options values follow PlannedResource and ResourceOptions; the descriptor
is interface-first and its implementation is internal. No runtime hosting, DI, reflection
serialization, or gateway implementation enters this package.

## Declarative commands (item 31c)

| Wire kind | Descriptor verb | Ownership key |
|---|---|---|
| `rezolvr.add-a-record` | `AddARecord` | record name |
| `rezolvr.add-cname-record` | `AddCnameRecord` | record name |

Kinds use verb-noun kebab under the area prefix. The examples `rezolvr.record` and
`identityhub.audience` in developer-experience design section 7 are illustrative; item 27's design
rewrite should reflect the landed convention. Manifest commands remain bare JSON strings. Typed
verbs validate argument shape and use source-generated JSON metadata. `Build` validates the advertised
kind, canonical payload, deterministic id, and uniqueness of the target ownership key. The default
control plane handles id replay and owner isolation; each area handler also accepts an identical
reapplication with a different id. Conflicts return named Rejected details.

A-record declarations use a BCL IPv4 IPAddress serialized as a string. CNAME declarations carry a
DNS target string; TTL is a positive integer in seconds, defaulting to 300. `COHAM001` keeps Dns
assemblies outside the ApplicationModel dependency closure.

Hosting stores records atomically in `records.json` under
`ResourceContext.GetMount("data", Path.GetFullPath(Path.Combine(ContentRootPath, "data")))`.
Without a data mount, storage therefore lives in the content-root-derived data directory. No
CohesionMount or CohesionWorkloadKind change is made: GenericPlanner requires StatefulSet for a
Volume while RezolvrPlanner requires Deployment. The command registry survives restart and restores
ownership before the listener starts.

Records are stored, not served as DNS answers. ResolverEndpointService remains parked. DNS serving
and reconciling a durable Volume with the Deployment contract are deferred area work.

## Declared dependencies
