# Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.ApplicationModel design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.ApplicationModel`.

> **Status:** Partial.

## Intent

This project is the `Database` area's AOT-compatible, dependency-guarded orchestration package. It
gives a gateway a typed database resource, a platform-neutral realization planner, and the default
control-plane factory that every orchestration-enabled database executable registers. It never
references `Database.Hosting`, an engine package, a gateway implementation, or a platform object
model.

An enabled `Sdk.Database` executable produces `cohesion/resource/v1` at build time. Generated
gateway code passes that `ResourceManifest` to `AddDatabase(...)`; the ApplicationModel package
does not reconstruct endpoint, mount, artifact, or lifecycle facts from conventions.

## Manifest-backed resource

`DatabaseResource` derives from `PlannedResource`. The base snapshots the supplied
`ResourceManifest` and projects its executable, endpoint, and mount compatibility surfaces. The
manifest remains the source of truth for:

- **executable/image** — identity;
- **the `db` and `admin`** — endpoints and their probes;
- **the persistent mounts and** — their declared sizes;
- **lifecycle limits, application identity,** — settings, and references; and
- **the default control-plane** — location.

The older constructor that accepted only a resource name and synthesized an
`Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.Application` artifact has been removed. That executable was an interim
framework-owned apphost; resource identity now belongs to the customer's generated manifest.

`DatabaseResourceOptions` derives from the shared `ResourceOptions`. It deliberately exposes only
deployer-owned planning overrides:

- **`Replicas`** — overrides `manifest.lifecycle.replicas`, subject to `maxReplicas` during
  model validation.
- **`Storage.Size`** — overrides each persistent claim's `mounts[].size` value.

Ports, mount paths, durability settings, and arbitrary environment values are resource facts owned
by the executable manifest, not deployer options. Consequently this package no longer declares or
emits resource-specific environment variables. Runtime values flow through the frozen
`Hosting.Resources` `ResourceContext` contract instead.

## `Database` planner

`DatabaseResource.CreatePlan(PlanContext)` is reported as `Database planner` in the application
build diagnostic. The planner enforces the `Database` area's persistent shape, then uses the shared
trait mapper to produce `cohesion/plan/v1`:

- **the workload is a** — `StatefulSet` with stable replica identity;
- **every `Volume` mount becomes** — a sized, per-replica claim;
- **each manifest endpoint becomes** — a stable service; and
- **exactly one portless, headless** — governing service anchors replica identity.

The result contains only Cohesion realization-plan records. Kubernetes claims, services,
StatefulSets, Docker volumes, and local directories are produced later by the selected platform
compiler. A checked-in golden plan pins the complete `Database` IR shape so compiler-facing changes
are explicit in review.

## Composition API

`AddDatabase(manifest, options)` creates a `DatabaseResource`, applies typed replica and storage
overrides, and adds it to the application graph. Planning remains deferred until
`IApplicationBuilder.Build()` so the planner receives the selected environment and the final
referenced-manifest map.

See the [source-backed usage examples](examples/index.md).

Generated gateway verbs supply the manifest and expose the same optional typed options; application
authors normally do not load the JSON themselves.

## Default control plane

`DatabaseResourceControlPlane.Create()` returns a fresh `Hosting.Resources` `IResourceControlPlane`
. The enabled resource's generated `ResourceControlPlane.g.cs` registers that factory with the
`Hosting.Resources` `ResourceRuntime` and seeds it with the invocation's observed endpoints.
`Database.Hosting` reads the registration through the shared `Hosting.Resources` contract and serves
it on the manifest's `admin` endpoint; neither package references the other.

The accepted kinds are `database.add-database` and `database.add-principal`. The typed descriptor
verbs record these declarations; Hosting owns their mutation handlers.

## Dependency and AOT posture

`COHAM001` constrains the complete production dependency closure to `Assimalign.Cohesion.Core`,
`Assimalign.Cohesion.ApplicationModel`, `Assimalign.Cohesion.Hosting`,
`Assimalign.Cohesion.Hosting.Health`, `Assimalign.Cohesion.Hosting.Resources`, and the permitted
BCL surface. The planner uses typed records and ordinary loops only. Golden serialization goes
through `ResourcePlanJsonContext`; there is no reflection, assembly scanning, runtime code
generation, runtime database dependency, or platform SDK dependency.

## Non-goals

- **Hosting engines, protocol servers,** — health endpoints, or database provisioning.
- **Inventing a manifest from** — a resource name or an executable-name convention.
- **Carrying platform-specific scheduling, storage-class,** — service, or claim types.
- **Connection settings or client** — factories; those belong to `Database.Client`.
- **Expanding runtime mutation capabilities** — or introducing engine dependencies into this package.

## Typed descriptors and commands

`AddDatabase` returns `IDatabaseResourceDescriptor`.
`RemoteReferenceDatabase(declaration, configure)` returns the same typed surface for a
manifest-backed external. Both preserve the canonical graph resource identity, dependency edges, and
command accumulation across rebinding.

`descriptor.AddDatabase(name, engine: null, optional: false)` records `database.add-database` with
`{ "database": name, "engine": engine }`; an omitted engine field selects the sole runtime engine.
`AddPrincipal(database, name, optional: false)` records `database.add-principal` with
`{ "database": database, "name": name }`. The database conflict key is `engine/database` when an
engine is supplied, otherwise the database name; the principal key is `database/name`. `Database`
names cannot contain `/`, so engine-prefixed keys remain unambiguous; engine names may contain `/`
. There are no credential or grant payload fields. A provider without a principal-mutation
capability returns a named rejection.

Source-generated JSON metadata produces canonical payload bytes through ApplicationModel. `Build()`
validates accepted kinds and graph ownership; no verb contacts the database.
