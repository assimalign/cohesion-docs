# Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.ApplicationModel

The AOT-compatible, dependency-guarded orchestration package for Cohesion databases.

> **Status:** Partial.

## Reference pages

- **[Design](design.md)** — Dependency boundaries and implementation decisions.
- **[Examples](examples/index.md)** — Source-backed usage and expected behavior.

The AOT-compatible, dependency-guarded orchestration package for Cohesion databases. It turns an
enabled database executable's build-produced `ResourceManifest` into a typed `DatabaseResource`,
applies deployer-owned replica and storage overrides, and emits a platform-neutral `ResourcePlan`
for the selected gateway compiler.

See the [source-backed usage examples](examples/index.md).

Generated gateway code normally supplies the manifest and exposes these typed options to application
authors.

## Scope

- **`DatabaseResource`** — a `PlannedResource` over the immutable manifest snapshot.
- **`DatabaseResourceOptions`** — typed `Replicas` and `Storage.Size` overrides.
- **`AddDatabase(manifest, options)`** — application-graph composition.
- **`Database` planner** — stable workload identity, sized per-replica volume claims, one
  service per endpoint, and a headless governing service.
- **`DatabaseResourceControlPlane`** — the `Database` default control-plane factory.

The control plane accepts `database.add-database` and `database.add-principal`. Typed descriptor
verbs `AddDatabase(name, engine)` and `AddPrincipal(database, name)` record those declarations; an
explicit engine gives the database an `engine/database` ownership key. `RemoteReferenceDatabase`
supplies the same typed surface for manifest-backed externals. `Principal` creation receives a named
rejection until the runtime supports principal mutation. `Database` names cannot contain `/`, which
keeps ownership keys unambiguous.

## Dependencies

- **`Assimalign.Cohesion.ApplicationModel`** — for manifests, planned resources, and the
  platform-neutral realization-plan IR.
- **`Assimalign.Cohesion.Hosting.Resources`** — for the default control-plane contract and runtime seam.

The project is guarded by `COHAM001` and never references `Database` runtime, gateway, or platform
packages. It emits no legacy resource-specific environment variables; runtime endpoint and mount
values flow through the `Hosting.Resources` `ResourceContext`.
