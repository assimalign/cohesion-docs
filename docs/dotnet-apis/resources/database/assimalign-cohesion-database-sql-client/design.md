# Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.Sql.Client design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.Sql.Client`.

> **Status:** Partial.

The SQL client owns parameter encoding, response decoding and materialization, typed
commands/results, and error/telemetry mapping. It delegates dialing, startup/authentication,
framing, and pooling to the shared client.

## Family position

The SQL client references shared mechanics and its model's codecs:

    SqlClient --> Sql["Database.Sql"]
    Client --> Protocol["Database.Protocol"]
    Sql --> Protocol
```

| Package | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `Database.Sql.Client` | SQL materialization and typed APIs |
| `Database.Client` | Pooling, handshake, framed exchange lifetime |
| `Database.Sql` | SQL identifiers and payload codecs |
| `Database.Protocol` | Shared framing and immutable family binding |

Other model clients do not depend on this package.

## SQL-owned exchange

`SqlClient.Create` binds the pool to `SqlProtocol.Family`. `SqlExecuteExchange` implements
`IDatabaseProtocolExchange<DatabaseClientResult>`: it encodes parameters with `DatabaseValueCodec`
, writes the execute request, consumes SQL's header/data/completion exchange, and materializes
values. `SqlConnection` projects this result into `SqlResultSet`.

`SqlProtocolConnectionExtensions.ExecuteAsync` provides the same operation on a rented
`IDatabaseConnection` bound to SQL's exact family instance. `DatabaseClientResult` and
`DatabaseClientColumn` moved to this package's namespace. Typed SQL APIs and protocol 1.0 wire
behavior are unchanged.

The model reference supplies codecs without parsing SQL or inspecting plans. Its transitive assembly
closure is an accepted packaging consequence; a dedicated model protocol assembly can be a future
refinement. The model's [design](../assimalign-cohesion-database-sql/design.md) defines wire
ownership.

## Typed projection

`Column` names map to ordinals once, shared by every result record. First column wins duplicate names;
ordinal access reaches every value. Exact runtime types are returned directly; widening getters use
`Convert.ChangeType` and invariant culture, without reflection. Incompatible access produces
`InvalidCast`.

Parameter collection names strip a leading `@` or `$`; bare names travel on the wire. SQL parsing
remains the server's responsibility.

## Lifecycle, errors, and telemetry

Disposing a typed connection returns its shared authenticated session; disposing the client closes
its pool. Connections support one exchange at a time.

`ISqlConnection.AbortAsync` discards a rental and closes its session instead of returning it to the
pool. `Use` it when SQL session state cannot be reset, including a failed ROLLBACK or uncertain
COMMIT. It delegates to the shared client's discard operation and is not cancellable. Discarding
prevents session leakage; it cannot undo an already published transaction.

SQL transactions currently use ordinary `BEGIN`, `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK` commands on one
connection. The wire protocol does not expose a durable transaction token, status lookup or replay
deduplication. A connection loss after the server publishes COMMIT but before the response reaches
the client has an unknown outcome. Client exceptions do not promise that a failed COMMIT left no
writes.

`SqlClientException : DatabaseException` maps stable wire codes to SQL error kinds and retains the
original code. The shared pool invalidates incomplete exchanges, including cancellation and decoder
failure. Completed parse/execution failures keep the connection reusable.

Observers receive synchronous primitive callbacks before execution, on completion, and on failure.
Observer exceptions are swallowed so telemetry cannot change the command outcome.

## AOT and non-goals

Encoding and materialization are hand-written, with no reflection or code generation. Transports are
typed options, never string-named plugins. Full result materialization is SQL client policy; an
incremental API can be added here independently. Parsing, ORM behavior, retries, and explicit wire
transactions remain outside the current surface.
