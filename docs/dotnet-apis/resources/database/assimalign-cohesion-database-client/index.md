# Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.Client

The shared client core of the Data Platform: the protocol client every per-model client (`Sql.Client`, `KeyValuePair.Client`, `Blob.Client`, …) builds on.

> **Status:** Implemented.

The shared client core of the Data Platform: the protocol client every per-model client
(`Sql.Client`, `KeyValuePair.Client`, `Blob.Client`, …) builds on. It dials a
`libraries/Connections` transport, runs the startup/authenticate/ready handshake, runs model-owned
framed exchanges, and pools authenticated connections.

## Scope

- **`IDatabaseClient`** — the pooling entry point (`DatabaseClient.Create`):
  `RentAsync` returns an open, authenticated connection; disposing a rented
  connection returns it to the pool with its server session intact.
- **`IDatabaseConnection`** — one protocol session: `OpenAsync` (handshake) and
  `ExecuteAsync<TResult>(IDatabaseProtocolExchange<TResult>)` returning the model's
  result. The exchange supplies codecs and materialization policy.
  Streaming Blob downloads keep this exchange active while the caller reads;
  content stream disposal cancels unfinished work before releasing the rental.
- **`DatabaseClientOptions.Family`** — the model family fixed for every connection
  in the pool. The exchange must use the exact same family instance.
- **`DatabaseConnectionSettings`** — typed settings with a minimal `key=value;`
  connection-string parser (`Database`, `Principal`, `Endpoint=host[:port]`,
  `MaxPoolSize`), plus `For(Uri)` for generated or ambient resource
  endpoints.
- **`DatabaseClientException`** — the client error root, carrying the wire's
  stable `ProtocolErrorCode`.

## Dependencies

`Database` (root contracts + exception root), `Database.Protocol` (framing + shared messages and
family binding), `Connections` (transport factories).

## Usage

See the [source-backed usage examples](examples/index.md).

Generated and ambient endpoints stay typed:

See the [source-backed usage examples](examples/index.md).

`For(Uri)` requires a Cohesion endpoint URI—an absolute, host-bearing value with a valid port and no
user information, query, or fragment—and maps its `IdnHost` and `Port` directly to the socket
endpoint without formatting and reparsing a string.

See [DESIGN.md](design.md) for the pooling and settings decisions.

## Declarative commands

`DatabaseCommandClient.Create(Uri controlPlaneAddress, string bearerToken, HttpMessageInvoker transport)`
accepts a caller-owned transport, including its TLS trust policy. Disposing the returned client does
not dispose that transport; the caller retains it until requests finish and disposes it afterward.
The two-argument factory still creates a transport owned and disposed by the client. Both overloads
perform the same endpoint and credential validation; a null supplied transport throws
`ArgumentNullException`. The client does not discover application trust.

`IDatabaseCommandClient` is the separate HTTP admin command contract. `DatabaseCommandClient.Create`
accepts the full manifest control-plane URI (including its path) and an opaque bootstrap bearer.
`SendCommandAsync` posts the camel-case id/kind/owner/key/payload envelope to commands; payload is
base64. `DeleteCommandAsync` sends DELETE to the same route and envelope. Both return package-local
`ResourceCommandObservation` with Status and Detail, retaining actionable provider refusal text.
Transport failures propagate; HTTP refusals become Rejected observations. Serialization uses
explicit Utf8JsonWriter/JsonDocument access. The caller disposes the client; redirect following and
cookies are disabled. No runtime Hosting or ApplicationModel dependency was added.
