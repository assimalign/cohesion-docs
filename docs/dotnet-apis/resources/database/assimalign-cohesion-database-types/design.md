# Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.Types design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.Types`.

> **Status:** Partial.

The shared scalar type system (area architecture: resources/`Database`/DESIGN.md
(`cohesion/docs/resources/Database/DESIGN.md`) §3.2). One rule drives everything here: **all type
intelligence is spent at encoding time so that comparison time is a raw unsigned byte compare.**
That is the design center `Database.Indexing` documents for `IndexKey` (the memcmp-key approach of
InnoDB and FoundationDB tuples) — this project owns the encodings; Indexing owns the physical
structures that compare them.

## Design intent

Five model engines store and index values. If each defined its own ordering, a key written by the
SQL engine and read by an index cursor — or replicated to another node — could disagree about order,
which corrupts range scans silently. Centralizing identity (`DatabaseType`), collation, and encoding
in one leaf project every model references makes cross-model ordering a compile-time fact rather
than a convention.

## Why-this-not-that decisions

- **Self-describing components (a `DatabaseType` tag byte per component)** rather
  than schema-required decoding. Costs one byte per component; buys: nulls with
  defined order (tag 0 sorts first), deterministic cross-type ordering (by tag),
  decodability without a schema in hand (debugging, generic tooling, replication),
  and loud failures on type mismatch. Schema-directed tagless encoding is a
  measured-need optimization that can arrive later behind the same writer surface.
- **Sealed `Collation` set instead of pluggable collations.**
  A collation is a *persistence contract* — its id is inside every encoded key on
  disk. Runtime-registered collations would make file portability depend on process
  configuration. Adding one is deliberately a kernel change here. `Binary` compares
  by Unicode code point (equals UTF-8 byte order), *not* `string.CompareOrdinal` —
  UTF-16 code-unit order disagrees with code-point order for supplementary-plane
  characters, and the byte encoding is the ground truth.
- **Three deterministic index-backed collations (#1025).** `Binary` (id 0) keeps
  UTF-8 unchanged; `CaseInsensitive` (id 2) applies Unicode default simple case
  folding; `CaseAccentInsensitive` (id 3) applies canonical decomposition, removes
  all `Mn`/`Mc`/`Me` marks, then applies the same fold. Canonical decomposition
  includes Hangul and excludes compatibility decomposition. Simple folding uses
  the `C` and `S` mappings, excludes Turkic tailoring, and does not expand sharp S
  into `ss`. Combining marks remain significant under `CaseInsensitive`.
- **Unicode 17.0 data is pinned in source.** Neither the three byte transforms nor
  their comparisons and hashes use runtime normalization, casing, or `CompareInfo`.
  They work identically under invariant globalization and across ICU upgrades.
  The generator (`cohesion/resources/Database/Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.Types/tools/Generate-CollationUnicodeData.ps1`) verifies SHA-256 hashes
  of the official [CaseFolding.txt](https://www.unicode.org/Public/17.0.0/ucd/CaseFolding.txt)
  and [UnicodeData.txt](https://www.unicode.org/Public/17.0.0/ucd/UnicodeData.txt) inputs;
  Unicode License v3 (`cohesion/resources/Database/Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.Types/docs/UNICODE_LICENSE.txt`) covers the generated tables. Updating
  Unicode behavior requires a new persisted collation identity, never replacing
  the mappings of an existing id.
- **Folded keys contain only canonical bytes.** Layout is the existing type tag,
  stable collation id, and escaped/terminated transformed UTF-8. There is no original
  spelling tie-breaker: equal strings must have identical keys and unique-lock
  hashes. The reader returns the canonical comparison value for folding collations;
  row/value storage retains original spelling. Binary keys keep their prior bytes.
- **Legacy `Invariant` (id 1) is not index-backed.** It retains linguistic scan
  comparison and matching hashing for compatibility. `New` key encoding rejects it;
  historical encoded keys remain readable. Only this legacy collation consults
  `CompareInfo`, and linguistic operations reject invariant globalization explicitly
  instead of silently becoming ordinal. SQL predicates using it must scan.
- **`Decimal` as normalized scientific notation** (sign byte, biased base-10 exponent,
  significant digits `+1`, terminator; negatives stored complemented) rather than
  scaled-integer bit tricks. `System.Decimal`'s 96-bit mantissa + scale
  representation is not order-preserving under any fixed-width bit fold without
  rescaling overflow hazards; digit-string scientific form is trivially correct,
  round-trips exactly (trailing zeros normalize away), and its cost is acceptable
  for key encoding.
- **IEEE-754 total-order fold for floats**, with NaN canonicalized to the *positive*
  quiet NaN — .NET's `double.NaN` constant carries the sign bit and would otherwise
  order below negative infinity. Resulting order: −∞ < finite < −0.0 < +0.0 < +∞ < NaN.
- **Zero-escaping for variable-length payloads** (`0x00` → `0x00 0xFF`, terminator
  `0x00 0x00`): keeps escaped-byte order identical to raw-byte order while making
  component boundaries unambiguous — the standard tuple-encoding scheme.
- **Time semantics:** `DateTime` orders by ticks with the kind preserved but
  non-ordering (store UTC when kinds could mix — documented on the API);
  `DateTimeOffset` orders by UTC instant with the offset preserved and tie-breaking;
  `Guid` orders by RFC 4122 big-endian bytes (not SQL Server's segment order).
- **JSON kinds are not key components.** `DatabaseType.Json`/`JsonBinary` exist as
  identities for storage/coercion, but ordering JSON is a model-level semantic; the
  writer exposes no append for them.
- **`DatabaseValueCodec` — one boxed-value bridge, not per-consumer switches.** The
  wire protocol (#852) moves *untyped* values in both directions: a client encodes
  boxed parameter values, the server decodes them, and result rows make the same
  trip in reverse. Both ends need the identical runtime-type→component mapping;
  duplicating the switch in model servers and their `.Client` materializers would let the
  two drift (a wire-corruption class of bug). The codec dispatches on runtime type
  (`Append`), reads self-describing components back boxed (`Read`), and offers
  single-component helpers (`EncodeComponent`/`DecodeComponent`) as the parameter
  payload format. Strings use `Collation.Binary` — these boundaries need exact
  round-trips, never ordering. This is *not* the `DatabaseValue` union (still a
  non-goal below): no value type is introduced, only a mapping.

## Error model

`DatabaseTypeException` is the project root: unknown collation ids, malformed or truncated key
bytes, component-type mismatches, invalid Unicode scalar sequences, and attempts to encode a
non-index-backed collation. Decoding is strict.

## AOT posture

No reflection; the index-backed collations use immutable span-based Unicode tables with no
globalization dependency. Only legacy `Invariant` scan operations use the runtime invariant
`CompareInfo`. `DatabaseKeyReader` is a `ref struct`; `DatabaseKeyWriter` is reusable via
`Reset()`. String transforms allocate their canonical text and UTF-8 payload.

## Non-goals

- **No boxed value union (`DatabaseValue`) yet** — planners and catalogs (#173, #175)
  will motivate its exact shape; encoding does not need it.
- **No per-language, user-defined, or** — full linguistic index-backed collations; those
  require a persisted versioning design (#1026).
- **No compression or tagless** — schema-directed encoding (see decision above).
