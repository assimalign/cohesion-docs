# Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.Testing design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.Testing`.

> **Status:** Partial.

## Design intent

A database resource's schema and runtime composition live in its ordinary `Program.cs`. Integration
tests must not reproduce that composition in a callback or a second bootstrap: doing so can pass
while the deployable executable, generated accessors, or default control plane is broken.
`DatabaseApplicationTestFactory.FromProgram<TProgram>()` therefore drives the executable entry point
itself under a test-scoped carrier.

This is the `Database` equivalent of an application factory, but its boundary differs from the
socketless Web factory. `Database` wire clients already abstract their transports, while an
SDK-enabled `Database` resource also has generated inputs, before-accept provisioning, a long-running
host, and an HTTP admin plane. The factory preserves all of those layers and uses loopback endpoints
by default.

## Invocation model

```text
DatabaseApplicationTestFactory.FromProgram<Program>()
  -> resolve Program's statically referenced assembly and compiler entry point
  -> Hosting.Resources ResourceRuntime.CreateScope(test ResourceContext)
  -> LongRunning Task (captures the scoped ResourceContext)
  -> Assembly.EntryPoint.Invoke(args)
       -> Program.Main
          -> DatabaseApplication.CreateBuilder(args)
          -> generated control plane + ambient endpoints/mounts
          -> Build() / RunAsync()
  -> poll GET admin /readyz while Program.Main remains live
```

`TProgram` is an assembly and entry-point marker, not a composition interface. Requiring an
`IDatabaseApplicationProgram` implementation or a factory delegate would add a test-only API to
every resource and create a second path around top-level statements. Generated code registers an
enabled resource's control-plane factory with `ResourceRuntime`; the testing package invokes the
compiler-rooted entry while that `Hosting.Resources` seam carries the context.

The marker must be the actual declaring type of `Assembly.EntryPoint`. `For` C# top-level statements,
consumers make the compiler-created type nameable with an empty `public partial class Program { }`
declaration. The entry point may accept no arguments or one `string[]`, and may return `void`,
`int`, `Task`, or `Task<int>`.

## Lifecycle contract

| Phase | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `FromProgram` | Validates the marker and options; creates or adopts a `Hosting.Resources` `ResourceContext`. Nothing runs. |
| `StartAsync` | Starts one long-running entry invocation inside the scoped context, then polls `GET /readyz` until healthy or the startup budget expires. Repeated calls after readiness are no-ops. |
| Running | The `Hosting.Resources` `ResourceRuntime` keeps the context isolated in that invocation's async flow. The test reaches SQL through `db` and management through `admin`. |
| `StopAsync` | Posts `/cohesion/v1/stop`, waits for `Program.Main` to complete, and clears the invocation so a deliberate restart can use a fresh scope. A never-started stop is a no-op. |
| `DisposeAsync` | Bounds graceful stop with `ShutdownTimeout`, then best-effort removes a factory-owned temporary data mount. Custom mounts remain caller-owned. |

The control plane is the source of truth for readiness and shutdown. The factory neither cancels an
unrelated task nor disposes engines behind the composition root's back. `Program` scope disposal
remains responsible for application and engine disposal after graceful stop.

## Isolation and parallelism

Each default factory owns unique loopback ports and a unique data directory. The The
`Hosting.Resources` `ResourceContext` travels through `ResourceRuntime.CreateScope`, which is
asynchronous-flow local; the factory never edits `COHESION_*` process variables. Generated
registrations are assembly keyed and create a new control-plane instance for each builder.
Consequently, multiple factories can run concurrently when their supplied contexts do not reuse
ports or mounts.

Port reservation and later binding are distinct operating-system operations, so a hostile external
process can still claim a released ephemeral port. Tests needing absolute endpoint coordination
should supply a context with ports reserved by their own harness.

## AOT and trimming posture

Top-level C# entry points have compiler-synthesized method names, so reflection-free method naming
is not available. The signed runtime design permits exactly one lookup: `Assembly.EntryPoint`, on a
method the compiler already roots. The enabled resource's generated module initializer applies
`DynamicDependency` to public and non-public `Program` methods and registers the assembly entry.
`FromProgram<TProgram>()` applies the matching `DynamicallyAccessedMembers` annotation to its
statically referenced marker. The small invocation method carries an explicit trimming suppression
documenting why this one lookup and invoke are safe.

There is no assembly scan, `Assembly.Load*`, string-to-type activation, expression compilation,
reflection-based serialization, or runtime code generation. The testing package is therefore
trim/NativeAOT safe within the deliberately documented entry-point exception.

## Hosting-isolation exception

Resource-area libraries normally cannot reference their concrete `*.Hosting` module (`COHRES001`).
The area's testing package is the single standing exception because its sole purpose is to drive
that concrete runtime. Its project declares exactly:

```xml
<CohesionHostingIsolationExemptions>Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.Hosting</CohesionHostingIsolationExemptions>
```

The exception does not flow to production libraries. `Database.Testing` is framework-neutral test
infrastructure and the nonpackable SDK sample is consumer/E2E evidence; neither moves or duplicates
runtime implementation.

## Real-process verification

The package's own tests also build
`resources/Database/Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.Testing/fixtures/Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.SampleHost`
through the real `Assimalign.Cohesion.Sdk.Database` with `CohesionApplicationModel=enabled`. The
test reference uses `ReferenceOutputAssembly=false`, loads `obj/.../cohesion/resource.json`, and
asks `LocalGateway` to launch the manifest's apphost. The test reads the gateway's stable
`<state>/<application>/.state/ports.json` carrier to address the realized endpoints; it does not
depend on an application-export API. Coverage asserts:

- **`Database`** — manifest defaults and generated `Resource`/control-plane source;
- **real-process readiness, liveness, health,** — endpoint discovery, command discovery, and
  graceful stop on the `admin` endpoint;
- **the advertised `database.add-database` and** — `database.add-principal` command kinds; the latter
  returns a named runtime refusal until a principal mutation seam exists;
- **typed SQL client round-trips** — on the realized `db` endpoint; and
- **recovery of committed rows** — after a graceful gateway stop and relaunch over the same
  materialized volume.

## Non-goals

- **Assertions, fixture base classes,** — and test-framework adapters.
- **A second builder/composition callback** — or resource-specific bootstrap interface.
- **Schema compilation or migration** — policy; the resource's normal builder owns declarations
  and provisioning, and their dedicated work items own compilation.
- **Replacing real-process gateway tests** — The in-process factory gives fast resource tests;
the sample E2E independently validates the SDK manifest and process carrier.

The fixture declares and compiles its relational schema with `Database.Sql.Schema` 's
`SqlSchema.Compile`, then passes the compiled identity to Hosting's `AddDatabase`. The SDK
analyzes that same declaration at build time. Hosting's before-accept provisioning order and the
fixture's runtime behavior are unchanged.

## Bootstrap identity (O35)

Default program factories issue an ephemeral ES256 JWT with issuer `tests`, subject `inprocess`,
and the program assembly name as audience. The ambient context carries the token and its public
P-256 trust JWK. Internal stop requests send that JWT as Bearer; public clients remain
uncredentialed. Custom managed contexts must supply a matching JWT and public trust key.

## Phase 29 `Database` composition migration

`Database` programs now capture `AddSql((context, engine) => ...)` intent, register the server through
that engine builder's deferred `AddServer` factory, and identify deferred provisioning with the
engine name. One application `Build` constructs and owns the engine and nested server; the program
disposes the application. The standalone template still uses its ordinary local data path. This
migration changes composition only; it adds no ApplicationModel declarations, manifests or resource
control planes. Template acceptance explicitly builds all five emitted `Database` programs because
resources-only changes do not trigger the Templates workflow.
