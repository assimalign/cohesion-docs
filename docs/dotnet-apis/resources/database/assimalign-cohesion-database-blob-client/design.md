# Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.Blob.Client design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.Blob.Client`.

> **Status:** Partial.

## Ownership and family

The typed client binds `Database.Client` to the exact `BlobProtocol.Family` instance.
`IBlobClient.ConnectAsync` rents an authenticated shared connection and wraps its lease in
`IBlobConnection`. `Database` selection happens in the shared handshake and is immutable; Blob
requests carry container and object names only. The client never chooses a concrete transport and
owns no parallel handshake, frame parser, or connection pool.

The dependency arrows below point from each consuming package to its dependency.

| Package | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.Blob.Client` | Typed operation APIs, Blob transfer validation, bounded list materialization, client errors |
| `Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.Client` | Pool leases, transport dialing, startup handshake, framed exchanges, bounded streaming lifetime |
| `Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.Blob` | Blob codecs, shared transfer state machine, engine and server |
| `Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.Protocol` | Family validation, frame envelope, startup and error vocabulary |
| `Assimalign.Cohesion.Connections` | Transport-neutral connection factory |

Public APIs are client interfaces, a static factory, options, and a typed exception. Blob consumes
the shared streaming exchange contract without changing its own caller-facing connection contract or
its model's wire protocol. Explicit codecs and ordinary generic delegates keep the implementation
compatible with `net10.0` and NativeAOT without reflection. The streaming migration adds no
dependencies or shipped-library `InternalsVisibleTo` grants.

## Upload and atomic publication

Upload sends `Write(container, name, overwrite)` followed by `BlobProtocolTransfer.SendAsync`. The
shared Blob helper sends start metadata, reads one at-most-65,536-byte source chunk, sends it, and
waits for a cumulative acknowledgement before advancing the source. It verifies known length and
finishes with `TransferComplete(actualLength)`. The client then requires a second
`TransferComplete` from the server with the same count: this is publication acknowledgement. The
caller's stream stays open on success, cancellation, and failure.

Acknowledgement of each chunk only establishes destination acceptance. The server's explicit
transaction publishes metadata after verified transfer completion, successful destination disposal,
and commit. Premature EOF, incorrect counts, failed source reads, cancellation, or disconnect during
reception abort the transaction. A preexisting blob remains visible until replacement commits; no
partial replacement or partial new blob is readable.

There is no idempotency token or exactly-once claim. If the client sends completion and then loses
the connection or is canceled, the server may already have committed the complete blob. A failed
client call alone cannot distinguish that outcome from an aborted upload. Successful return is
stronger: it confirms receipt of the matching publication acknowledgement.

## Streaming downloads and bounded memory

Downloads implement `IDatabaseStreamingExchange`. Its `OpenAsync` phase sends the Blob read request
and validates `TransferStart`; `DownloadAsync` returns only after that validation, so errors before
startup fail the method itself. Its `CopyToAsync` phase passes the metadata, frame adapters, and
borrowed destination stream to `BlobProtocolTransfer.ReceiveAsync`, which verifies chunks, counts,
acknowledgements, and terminal completion. This is Blob-specific wire work. The shared client runs
the producer and owns the content stream and its lifetime. `BlobDownloadStream` is only an exception
facade over that shared stream.

The shared content stream reads from a single-slot bounded queue. The shared destination adapter
copies received content into entries no larger than 65,536 bytes because incoming frame payload
ownership belongs to the frame reader. Once the queue fills, destination writes wait for consumer
progress, which also stops further protocol acknowledgements. Content memory is bounded by the
consumer's current chunk, one queued chunk, a pending destination chunk, and a fixed number of
frame/source buffers, independent of object length. Caller-controlled read/copy buffers are
additional. The server must use file-backed storage for objects larger than its heap; an in-memory
engine necessarily retains its stored content.

The sequence shows when streaming may return to the caller while the shared exchange stays active.

```mermaid

    participant A as Application
    participant C as Blob client
    participant E as Shared exchange
    participant S as Blob server
    A->>C: DownloadAsync
    C->>E: ExecuteStreamingAsync
    E->>S: Read
    S-->>E: TransferStart
    E-->>C: Shared stream after startup validation
    C-->>A: Stream
    loop Bounded content flow
        S-->>E: Chunk
        E->>E: Await bounded destination write
        A->>E: ReadAsync through Blob facade
        E-->>S: ChunkAcknowledgement
    end
    S-->>E: TransferComplete
    E-->>A: EOF after verified completion and queued content
```

The shared producer records failure independently of queue completion. Reads consult that sticky
failure before returning content and before returning EOF. Queue exhaustion alone never means
success: EOF requires verified protocol completion. A server error, connection truncation, or
invalid count throws `BlobClientException`, even if earlier reads yielded valid chunks. Subsequent
reads continue to throw. Consumers must discard partial destination content if a copy fails. Streams
are read-only, sequential, and reject simultaneous reads; length and seek are unsupported even when
the server declared a length.

## Cancellation, disposal, and pooled leases

Each connection allows only one exchange. Starting another while one is active fails promptly with
`InvalidOperationException`. Downloads call `IDatabaseConnection.ExecuteStreamingAsync`, so a
healthy typed connection retains its caller-owned shared pool lease until connection disposal; a
background producer cannot accidentally return that lease while using frames. Normal verified
completion releases the operation slot, even if some verified bytes remain in the download's bounded
local queue. `Dispose` downloads before starting subsequent work.

The download-start token remains active on the returned stream. Disposing the connection cancels and
joins an active producer. A token passed to any asynchronous read cancels the whole transfer,
including a producer blocked on a full queue or awaiting a wire frame. Synchronous or asynchronous
stream disposal cancels an unfinished producer, waits for its completion and connection teardown,
and discards remaining queued bytes. It suppresses already-recorded transfer failures; reads are the
error surface. Disposing a fully completed stream leaves the connection healthy. Connection disposal
cancels and joins any current operation before returning its lease. Disposing a pooled client
follows the shared ownership rule: dispose rented connections first.

Cancellation surfaces as `OperationCanceledException`. Failed source streams may also propagate
their own exception types; transport-style failures are translated by the shared client. After any
failed exchange, the client immediately returns its invalidated rental so transport closure wakes
the server and causes unfinished uploads to roll back. No retry or resume occurs.

## Errors and metadata operations

A model reader adapter recognizes shared `Error` frames and throws `DatabaseClientException` with
their original code and message before `BlobProtocolTransfer` can collapse them into
`ProtocolException`. Preserving diagnostics at that helper boundary remains necessary, but the
adapter no longer changes the exception type to force pool invalidation. The shared pool uses the
exchange's completion evidence instead of inspecting the error code. Blob failures never certify
that the session is reusable: every Blob server error terminates its session, and an abandoned
transfer may retain unread frames.

The typed operation boundary and the download stream facade translate shared client errors to
`BlobClientException` only after shared health processing. This retains the existing Blob error
surface, original wire code, and sticky read failures. Ordinary Blob operations also retain their
frame-only adapters for completed transport pipes that report `InvalidOperationException`: these
preserve existing Blob upload and metadata diagnostics without changing SQL or `Key`-Value transport
behavior. Downloads use the shared streaming frame adapters for that normalization. These adapters
do not control connection health or intercept errors from caller-owned streams. Blob-specific
codecs, transfer validation, acknowledgements, publication acknowledgement, metadata shapes, and
typed exception mapping remain in Blob; producer coordination, content buffering, cancellation, and
connection release belong to the shared client.

`Delete` accepts only an operation completion count of zero or one. Properties accepts a single
matching item followed by completion(1), or completion(0) for absence. Listings yield metadata
through another one-slot queue, validating prefix membership and the final item count. Early
enumeration disposal cancels the producer and invalidates an unfinished exchange. The metadata
protocol has no per-item acknowledgement; this client bounds its own queue, but a transport without
backpressure may buffer an entire listing. Blob content retains its explicit one-chunk
acknowledgement window regardless of transport behavior.

Every server error, including ordinary missing-container or overwrite rejection, closes the
connection. Rent another connection to continue. Missing blob properties and deletion misses are
normal null/false results; downloading a missing blob is an error. Local malformed frames, ordering
mistakes, and truncation map to `ProtocolViolation`; transport failures map to `Internal`.
Deadline behavior comes from supplied cancellation tokens and server lifecycle options.

## Scope and verification

This package does not provision databases or containers, expose SQL commands, multiplex requests,
retry operations, resume content, introduce transport-specific convenience APIs, or expose a
buffered byte-array content API. Tests use `Connections.InMemory`, including nonseekable content,
interrupted uploads, cancellation in both directions, server errors, scoping, pooling, and a
file-backed transfer materially larger than a child process's managed heap.

The shared streaming contract also supports test-level consumers from a second model, so future
Documents and Graph clients can supply their own startup and content protocol without copying Blob's
former queue, producer, cancellation, or rental-release machinery. Listings remain a Blob-owned
bounded typed enumeration: they produce metadata items rather than a content stream and validate
Blob-specific prefix and item-count rules.
