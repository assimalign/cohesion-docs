# Assimalign.Cohesion.Database

The Database root defines model-neutral engine, database, session, transaction, and application contracts.

The contract root of the Cohesion Data Platform: the model-agnostic interfaces every engine
implements and every consumer programs against — `IDatabaseEngine` (a data machine managing logical
databases), `IDatabase` (a logical database), `IDatabaseSession` (scoped execution context), and
`IDatabaseTransaction` (explicit ACID scope) — plus the server seam (`IDatabaseServer`,
`IDatabaseServerContext`, `IDatabaseServerSession`; servers are per-model, each implemented inside
its model package), the application seam (`IDatabaseApplication`, `IDatabaseApplicationContext`,
`IDatabaseApplicationBuilder`), the model-agnostic provisioning surface (`CompiledSchema`,
`IDatabaseSchemaProvisioner`, `SchemaMigrationResult`), object ownership (`DatabaseObjectOwner`,
`DatabaseObjectLockedException`), the area's exception root (`DatabaseException`,
`DatabaseNotFoundException`, `DatabaseParseException`), and shared value objects (`DatabaseName`,
`EngineState`, `EngineModel`). The root is also the area's **rollup**: it references every child
root (Types, Language, `Storage`, Transactions, Execution, Indexing, Protocol, Security, Governance),
so one reference to the root delivers the whole base surface — including child-owned vocabulary the
contracts speak (`TransactionId` and `TransactionState` from `Database.Transactions`,
`ProtocolVersion` from `Database.Protocol`).

## Scope

- **Engine contracts** — create/open/drop/enumerate logical databases. Engines
  are **data machines**: operational from creation, no start/stop ceremony;
  disposal quiesces their background workers and durably flushes. `State` is
  observational (`Running`/`Faulted`/`Disposed`); `Workers` exposes the
  engine-owned background loops for diagnostics (name, kind, cadence).
- **Server contracts** — `IDatabaseServer` (start/stop lifecycle — "running"
  lives on the server, never the engine) with its observational
  `IDatabaseServerContext` (the one engine it fronts + active sessions).
  Servers are per-model and these contracts are the only area-wide
  requirement — each model implements them inside its model package
  (`SqlDatabaseServer` in `Database.Sql`).
- **`Application` composition seam** — `IDatabaseApplicationBuilder` /
  `IDatabaseApplication` / `IDatabaseApplicationContext`: model packages
  register deferred engines against this root seam (e.g.
  `Database.Sql`'s `AddSql((context, engine) => ...)` with nested server factories) without
  knowing the hosting implementation. Composition roots register background work
  through the concrete `DatabaseApplicationBuilder.AddService` in `Database.Hosting`;
  the root contracts expose no hosting-library types.
  `Database.Hosting` implements the seam (`DatabaseApplication.CreateBuilder(args)`)
  so services start before servers and stop after them in reverse order.
- **Model-agnostic provisioning** — `CompiledSchema` carries identity, the
  canonical document, and its content hash. `IDatabaseSchemaProvisioner` applies
  it and returns `SchemaMigrationResult`. SQL declarations and relational
  shapes live in `Database.Sql.Schema`; Hosting receives an already compiled
  schema through `AddDatabase(engine, name, schema)`.
- **`Object` ownership** — `DatabaseObjectOwner` distinguishes code-first
  provisioning from ad-hoc statements. Schema-owned objects require schema
  apply to change; ad-hoc objects remain mutable through session statements.
  `DatabaseObjectLockedException` identifies the refused object, owning schema,
  and operation.
- **Session contracts** — query execution (typed `QueryRequest` and
  language-text overloads) and transaction management. Sessions are
  single-threaded by contract; disposing one rolls back its active transaction.
- **Error root** — `DatabaseException` for the contract root and everything
  built above it; `DatabaseNotFoundException` for the exact missing-database
  outcome of `IDatabaseEngine.OpenDatabaseAsync`; `DatabaseParseException` for
  statement text a session's language rejects. Child roots own independent exception roots (see
  [DESIGN.md](design.md)).

## Dependencies

`Core`, the nine child roots the root rolls up (`Database.Execution`, `Database.Governance`,
`Database.Indexing`, `Database.Language`, `Database.Protocol`, `Database.Security`,
`Database.Storage`, `Database.Transactions`, `Database.Types` — child roots never reference the
root), and the existing private `Web` implementation reference (excluded from the package dependency
list). The HTTP `admin` control plane is a separate Hosting concern implemented through that
project's private `Web.Hosting` /`Web.Health` references.

## Consumers

Every `resources/Database/*` project. Model engines (`Database.Sql`, …) implement the contracts;
each model's server (`SqlDatabaseServer`, …) pumps wire-protocol frames into sessions;
`Database.Client` owns connection pooling and framed exchanges, while each model client materializes
results; `Database.Hosting` composes servers into a host.

See [DESIGN.md](design.md) for the contract-shape decisions.

Phase 29 adds `IDatabaseEngineBuilder` for model-agnostic deferred worker/server factories,
inherited by each model's options-bearing builder. `IDatabaseEngine.Servers` exposes nested servers
for host lifecycle discovery; engines retain their disposal ownership. Named engine operations now
use `DatabaseName`. `IDatabaseApplication` is asynchronously disposable, its context includes all
engines and ordinal `GetEngine(name)`, and its builder exposes `AddEngine`(instance/factory) plus
one-shot `Build` without a mutable registry or `Use` stage.
