# Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.Sql.Catalog design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.Sql.Catalog`.

> **Status:** Partial.

The SQL model's schema authority (area architecture: resources/`Database`/DESIGN.md
(`cohesion/docs/resources/Database/DESIGN.md`) §3.3). The catalog answers exactly two questions for
the planner: *what objects exist* (with stable identities) and *what shape are they* — and it must
answer identically after any crash.

## `Collation` metadata (#1025)

`SqlCatalogColumn.Collation` is an optional string-column override. Null inherits
`ISqlCatalog.DefaultCollation`, which is Binary when no default record exists. The default is
persisted in a dedicated kind-7 catalog record and captured in immutable statement snapshots.

`DefaultCollation` is read-only on the contract. The default is established when the catalog is
opened — `SqlCatalog.Open(storage, defaultCollation)` — and is fixed for the lifetime of the
database, because every index key on a column that inherited it is encoded through that collation's
byte transform. Opening an already-populated catalog under a different default is rejected;
reopening under the same one, or with no default supplied, keeps the persisted value.

Making this creation-time state rather than a mutator is deliberate: a setter on the contract would
tell every implementer the value is changeable and then guard that promise at runtime, which is the
kind of one-off bridging API the repo's abstraction rule exists to keep off interfaces.

Table metadata extension version 2 appends one collation identifier per column after the existing
constraints. Version-1 and pre-extension records still read with null column overrides and the
Binary database fallback. `Column` additions, drops, and restart preserve explicit overrides. An index
inherits its key columns' effective collations; the SQL engine verifies index eligibility and uses
those same transforms for uniqueness enforcement.

## Why-this-not-that decisions

- **A dedicated catalog storage file set** — not catalog rows mixed into the data
  file. The current row facade exposes one record space per storage instance;
  sharing it would put metadata records inside user table scans. A second
  `SqlStorage` (by convention `<database>.catalog`) buys complete isolation while
  reusing the exact same durability machinery — no bespoke metadata persistence.
  When the data file gains per-object record spaces, folding the catalog back in
  becomes an option, not a requirement.
- **Self-committing DDL.** Every catalog mutation runs in its own storage
  transaction and is durable (WAL commit record) when the call returns. DDL inside
  a user DML transaction is deliberately unsupported in the MVP: the in-memory
  cache updates on commit, and half-visible schema changes are a correctness trap
  (historically mishandled by real engines). The engine serializes DDL per
  database.
- **The shared tuple codec as the record format.** Catalog records are encoded
  with `DatabaseKeyWriter`/`DatabaseKeyReader` (#854): self-describing, exact
  round-trips, one codec maintained in one place. Ordering (the codec's other
  property) is irrelevant here — reuse beats a second bespoke format.
- **One record per table.** Columns and the primary key fold into the table's
  record: schema changes rewrite one record (in place when it fits, relocating —
  delete + insert — when it grows). Per-column records would buy nothing at this
  scale and cost multi-record consistency.
- **`Object` identities are catalog-assigned `ulong`s** persisted with a counter
  record, monotonic across reopen (the loader also raises the counter past every
  loaded table, so a torn counter update can never recycle an id). Data rows,
  index registrations, and lock resources key off these ids.
- **`Index` directory persistence lives here** — the index manager stays a physical
  component (`Database.Indexing`'s documented split): the catalog stores the
  exported `BTreeIndexRegistration` set and hands it back for re-attachment on
  open. `Root` page ids drift on splits; the engine re-saves at its persistence
  points (checkpoint/shutdown).
- **`Index` descriptions are schema metadata, one record per index (kind 5)** —
  `SqlCatalogIndex`: name (unique per table, case-insensitive), owning table
  object id, ordered key columns, uniqueness. The description is deliberately
  separate from the physical registration: the description is stable while root
  page ids drift, and the planner needs columns/uniqueness the registration
  doesn't carry. **Description and registration writes are atomic** —
  `CreateIndexAsync`/`DropIndexAsync` take the registration set and persist both
  records in one self-committing transaction, because a crash must never leave a
  description promising an index no tree backs (an unenforced UNIQUE) or a
  registration re-attaching a tree no statement can reach. `DropTableAsync`
  removes the table's descriptions and registrations the same way. Guards:
  dropping an indexed column is rejected (entries key on its values); index
  columns must exist at creation.
- **The record-space format version lives here** (kind-4 record,
  `RecordSpaceFormatVersion`): data rows are not self-describing across layout
  changes — a stamped (MVCC, version ≥ 2) record and an unstamped (version 1)
  record cannot be told apart record-by-record, and version 2 vs 3 (shared page
  stream vs per-object page chains) is a page-placement property no record
  carries — so the database-grain marker is catalog metadata, read by the
  engine at open to decide which in-place upgrade stages to run. Absent marker
  reads as version 1 (pre-marker databases); the engine writes the current
  version (3) after upgrading (or at creation, when the space is born on the
  current format).
- **The applied compiled-schema state lives here** (kind-6 records). The catalog
  stores the lowercase content hash together with the complete canonical schema
  document. Documents are strict UTF-8 and chunked into bounded records; replacing
  all old chunks with all new chunks is one self-committing storage transaction,
  so reopen observes either complete state. The SQL provisioner verifies both the
  document/hash pair and the live table/index catalog before treating a repeated
  apply as a no-op; the marker is never an authority over detected drift.

## `Object` ownership

Table and secondary-index records persist `DatabaseObjectOwner` and the owning compiled schema's
name. `SqlCatalogTable.Schema` is strictly the SQL namespace (for example, `dbo`);
`SqlCatalogTable.OwningSchema` is the compiled schema that provisioned the object and is null for
ad-hoc objects. `SqlCatalogIndex` exposes the same ownership value as `OwningSchema`, distinct from
its table's SQL namespace. Ordinary catalog creation defaults to `Adhoc`; the SQL provisioner's
`SqlCatalog.ReserveTableAsync` /`SqlCatalog.PublishTableAsync` path stamps `Schema` ownership and
`OwningSchema` atomically with the first table record. `Index` creation already accepts a complete
description and persists the same metadata. `Column` add/drop replacements retain the table's
ownership unchanged.

The ownership fields are an appended tuple suffix. Older records without the suffix load as `Adhoc`
, preserving their existing mutability rather than guessing an owner from a database-wide schema
marker. Invalid owner/name combinations are rejected. The tuple encoding is positional and never
persisted CLR property identifiers; renaming the ownership property to `OwningSchema` therefore does
not change the on-disk format, and catalogs written by the contract-freeze build load without a
compatibility alias. The schema hash/document record remains unchanged and continues to support
drift detection independently of per-object ownership.

The engine enforces the live-session DDL lock; the catalog remains the durable metadata component
used by sanctioned schema application as well. Ownership metadata is accepted by the
staged-publication statics on `SqlCatalog`; authorization to change an existing schema-owned object
remains an engine/session decision. `ISqlCatalog` itself has no new member. The older
direct-creation helpers remain internal and are used only by catalog tests.

## `Constraint` persistence

Table records now append a versioned constraint extension after ownership: version `1`, constraint
count, and each immutable foreign-key/check definition. A reference stores its ordered local and
target columns, target SQL namespace/table, and `RESTRICT` or `CASCADE` delete action. A check
stores its SQL expression. Records ending after the original primary keys or ownership suffix still
load with no constraints. Unknown extension versions and malformed definitions fail closed. `Column`
changes retain constraints, and add/drop constraint rewrites use the same WAL-backed,
self-committing record replacement as existing catalog metadata.

`UNIQUE` uses `SqlCatalogIndex.IsUnique`, matching `CompiledSchemaIndex.IsUnique`; it does not
acquire a competing foreign-key/check constraint kind. Creation of a table with unique declarations
reserves and durably advances its object identity, then the engine commits the empty index trees
before publishing the table, constraints, index descriptions, and registrations in one catalog
transaction. A crash before publication leaves no visible table with missing enforcement.
Replacement publication similarly commits newly added columns/constraints and their new indexes
together. `SqlCatalog.ReserveTableAsync(ISqlCatalog, ...)` and
`SqlCatalog.PublishTableAsync(ISqlCatalog, ...)` expose this composition lifecycle as
`public static` methods that downcast to the internal implementation - the same bridge shape as the
existing `CreateTableAsync` /`AddConstraintAsync` helpers, and for the same reason: the lifecycle is
a capability of *this* catalog, not a contract every `ISqlCatalog` implementation must honour. A
reservation persists only the identity counter and does not lock the name; callers serialize DDL and
durably build enforcing indexes before publishing. `New` publications reject zero or unallocated
identities so they cannot bypass the durable identity counter. Replacement publication retains
existing index descriptions while adding the supplied new descriptions.
`SqlCatalog.DropConstraintAsync(ISqlCatalog, ...)` owns removal of persisted foreign-key/check
metadata, alongside the existing table, column, and index mutations on the interface.

`Index` records have their own version-`1` trailing extension carrying `IsPrimaryKey`. This
identifies the physical index enforcing primary-key metadata, allowing schema reconciliation to
distinguish it from a separately declared unique index on the same columns. Older index records have
no marker and load as ordinary indexes.

## Single source for SQL system views (C1)

The engine's `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` and `COHESION_SCHEMA` relations project this catalog's table,
column, key, index, constraint, and ownership descriptions. Those descriptions remain the single
source of truth: system views are computed when queried and never inserted as stored catalog tables
or copied into a second metadata store. `SqlCatalogTable` describes stored objects only and gains no
virtual/system flag. SQL view names, columns, binding, and row projection belong to the SQL engine,
not to this persistence library.

`SqlCatalog.CaptureSnapshot(ISqlCatalog)` returns an `ISqlCatalogSnapshot` containing an atomic
capture of tables, index descriptions, and default collation under the catalog's metadata lock.
`ISqlCatalogSnapshot` is public because it is the return type of a public static method; the
implementation stays internal; callers can retain the read-only capture without holding a storage
handle or disposing it. Table columns, primary-key columns, and index key-column names are copied
into read-only collections when descriptions are created; callers cannot mutate retained input lists
to alter a published table or an already captured directory. The SQL session captures it at
transaction begin for snapshot isolation and at statement start for `ReadCommitted` or auto-commit.
The engine derives every view row and referenced constraint from that capture, preventing an
enumeration from mixing metadata before and after a DDL publication. Captures expose existing
catalog descriptions, with no SQL view binding, query execution, or mutable persistence capability.
These `SqlCatalog` statics replace the shipped-to-shipped friend grant without widening
`ISqlCatalog`: consistent reads and staged publication are capabilities of this catalog
implementation, and putting them on the interface would make every future implementation owe four
more members. After a table drop, fresh snapshots contain none of its table, index, constraint,
column, or ownership metadata. See the SQL engine's
[virtual relation design](../assimalign-cohesion-database-sql/design.md#virtual-system-relations-c1)
for the query surface and the two deliberately non-standard extension views.

## Error model

`SqlCatalogException : DatabaseException` for catalog violations (duplicate or missing
tables/columns, primary-key drops, malformed persisted records).

## Non-goals

- **Stored user-defined views, sequences,** — permissions (permissions are
  `Sql.Security`'s feature, #177). Virtual system views are engine projections
  of this catalog and require no view records here.
- **Multi-statement DDL atomicity (see** — self-committing DDL above). The migration
  layer compensates completed reversible statements on failure; an MVCC bracket
  spanning catalog and data DDL requires a future catalog batch-transaction seam.

## AOT posture

Value/data classes plus the shared codec — no reflection, no serialization libraries.
