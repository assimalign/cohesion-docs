# Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.Protocol design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.Protocol`.

> **Status:** Partial.

## Mechanism and model policy

This child root owns the frame envelope, shared payload primitives, startup and authentication
exchange, session lifecycle, error taxonomy, and version negotiation. It has no model dependencies.
As with `Database.Language`'s `TokenLexer`, `Diagnostic`, `QueryLanguageProfile` and `QueryParser`, mechanism
is shared while each model supplies its own grammar: here that grammar is its message family and
payload codecs.

The dependencies point from model policy toward the shared mechanism.

```mermaid

    Sql["Database.Sql"] --> Core["Database.Protocol"]
    Kv["Database.KeyValuePair"] --> Core
    Blob["Database.Blob"] --> Core
    Docs["Database.Documents"] --> Core
    Graph["Database.Graph"] --> Core
    Client["Database.Client"] --> Core
```

Each model package owns its message identifiers, encode/decode routines, and exchange ordering. Each
model's Client package owns result materialization. `Database.Client` owns pooling, handshake, framed
exchanges, and connection health. Each model server continues to own its accept loop and session
state machine.

## Envelope and primitives

Every frame begins with a five-byte header. `Header` bytes 0–3 (bits 0–31) are the unsigned 32-bit
payload length in big-endian order, and byte 4 (bits 32–39) is the unsigned 8-bit message type. The
payload starts at byte 5, and the declared length counts only those payload bytes, not the header.
Payloads are limited to 16,777,216 bytes. Readers check the length before allocation, require the
entire declared payload, distinguish clean EOF between frames from truncation, and reject oversized
declarations. Writers apply the same bound. Framing imposes no logical-object buffering or transfer
policy. The packet view below shows the two fixed header fields.

```mermaid
packet-beta
0-31: "Payload length (u32, big-endian)"
32-39: "Message type (u8)"
```

`ProtocolPayload` provides signed i32/i64, unsigned u16, and strings encoded as
`i32 UTF8-byte-length + UTF8 bytes`. Negative lengths and out-of-bounds reads fail with
`ProtocolException`. Codecs are direct span operations, with no reflection, Microsoft.Extensions
dependencies, serialization discovery, or generated runtime code.

## Numbering and the family seam

The endpoint selects the model before accept. Startup has no model discriminator. A connection
serves one model and one database throughout its lifetime. A client must choose the endpoint for the
family it speaks; the protocol cannot discover a misconfigured endpoint without the deliberately
deferred handshake discriminator.

| Identifier | Owner / meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Reserved, invalid |
| 1 | Core: Startup |
| 2 | Core: Authenticate |
| 3 | Core: AuthenticateResponse |
| 4 | Core: Ready |
| 5–9 | Model family, preserving deployed identifiers |
| 10 | Core: Error |
| 11 | Core: Ping |
| 12 | Core: Pong |
| 13 | Core: Terminate |
| 14–63 | Reserved for future shared mechanism |
| 64–255 | Model family |

A single contiguous model range would have renumbered deployed messages unnecessarily. Instead, 5–9
remain endpoint-scoped legacy slots, and new families use 64–255. Different endpoints may assign the
same byte differently. There is never a union of families or a per-message registry lookup on one
session.

`ProtocolMessageFamily` copies its identifier set, rejects duplicate and reserved identifiers, and
has no mutators. `ProtocolChannel` permanently binds one family to one stream and validates incoming
and outgoing identifiers against that family and the core. Model server sessions create the channel
exactly once. Client pools select one family when composed and reject exchanges belonging to another
family. Payload interpretation belongs exclusively to that endpoint's model codec. Unknown
identifiers are protocol violations; session code reports Error(ProtocolViolation) and closes.

The low-level `ProtocolFraming` reader/writer remain available for diagnostics and framing tests. They
deliberately do not dispatch payloads or infer model semantics. Applications use `ProtocolChannel` for
their endpoint's validated exchange.

## Shared exchange and payloads

The shared handshake precedes every model-specific exchange, as shown here.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as "Client core"
    participant Server as "Model endpoint"
    Client->>Server: Startup(version, database, principal)
    Server-->>Client: Authenticate
    Client->>Server: AuthenticateResponse
    Server-->>Client: Ready
    Note over Client,Server: Fixed endpoint family owns subsequent requests and results
    Client->>Server: Model request
    Server-->>Client: Model response messages
    Client->>Server: Ping
    Server-->>Client: Pong
    Client->>Server: Terminate
```

Startup is `u16 major + u16 minor + string database + string principal`. In its fixed prefix, bytes
0–1 (bits 0–15) are the big-endian unsigned 16-bit major version, bytes 2–3 (bits 16–31) are the
big-endian unsigned 16-bit minor version, and bytes 4–7 (bits 32–63) are the database string's
nonnegative big-endian signed 32-bit UTF-8 byte length `N`. The `N` database bytes start at byte 8;
the principal's nonnegative big-endian signed 32-bit UTF-8 byte length follows at byte `8 + N`,
followed by that many principal bytes. The packet view below shows the startup payload's fixed
eight-byte prefix.

```mermaid
packet-beta
0-15: "Major version (u16, big-endian)"
16-31: "Minor version (u16, big-endian)"
32-63: "Database UTF-8 byte length N (nonnegative i32, big-endian)"
```

The existing trust handshake sends an empty Authenticate and AuthenticateResponse; authenticators
receive response evidence as opaque bytes. Ready is empty in 1.0. Ping, Pong, and Terminate have
empty payloads. Error is `u16 code + string message`. Codes are append-only: Internal=0,
UnsupportedVersion=1, AuthenticationFailed=2, NotAuthorized=3, DatabaseNotFound=4, ParseFailure=5,
ExecutionFailure=6, TransactionAborted=7, ProtocolViolation=8, Unavailable=9. Statement failures can
leave a session ready; framing, handshake, or ordering violations terminate it.

## Version decision

`ProtocolVersion.Current` remains **1.0**. SQL and `Key`-Value deployed clients retain exactly the same
header, message identifiers, handshake, payload encodings, and exchange order. `New` families are
additive on separately selected model endpoints; no existing endpoint silently reinterprets an
identifier. Moving CLR types between assemblies is a source/package migration, not a wire-format
change.

`TryNegotiate` rejects any major other than 1 and chooses the minimum peer/server minor. Model
servers return UnsupportedVersion before authentication for incompatible majors. Version 1.0 Ready
stays empty, so no new version field is sent to old clients; success accepts the 1.0 baseline. A
future minor requiring capabilities must negotiate them explicitly before use. An incompatible
change to an existing endpoint's meaning or payload requires a deliberate major bump; changing only
framing is not the sole reason to bump a major. Unknown identifiers never trigger a fallback to
another family.

## Extending a model

Define a model-owned identifier enum, a single immutable family, codecs, and its ordering rules.
`Bind` that family at endpoint accept and client pool composition. `Use` shared `ProtocolPayload`
primitives where appropriate, and document the exact wire payload in the owning model package. `Add`
transport-independent conformance coverage through Connections.InMemory. Models do not add payload
policy to this core.

`ProtocolException` is this child root's independent exception type. Servers translate it to the
shared wire taxonomy; the client core translates it to `DatabaseClientException`. Transports remain
outside this package and outside engine packages.
