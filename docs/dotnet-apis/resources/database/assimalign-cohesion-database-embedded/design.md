# Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.Embedded design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.Embedded`.

> **Status:** Partial.

## Intent

The `Database` area is the data layer for the rest of the Cohesion platform (area `DESIGN.md` R10).
Most platform resources should not run — or depend on — a separate database server process for their
own state; they embed the engines they need. This project is that consumption path, and it is
deliberately thin.

## The engine self-sufficiency principle

The facade can only be thin because of an invariant this project *enforces by existing*: **engines
are self-sufficient libraries**. An engine owns its internal background workers — WAL flushing,
checkpointing, version pruning — whether it runs embedded or hosted. `Database.Hosting` merely
composes the per-model wire-protocol servers that front engines; it adds no behavior an embedded
consumer would lose (since 2026-07-13 the engine's worker loops are engine-internal, always — there
is no host scheduling to miss). If an engine ever requires the host to function, embedded consumers
break — that is a design defect in the engine, not a missing feature here.

## Decisions

- **Composition only.** `EmbeddedDatabase` registers engines, looks them up by name or model, and disposes them in reverse registration order. It does not proxy engine operations — consumers work with `IDatabaseEngine`/`IDatabase` directly, so embedded and hosted code paths stay identical.
- **No DI.** Repo rule: `*.Hosting` is the only DI seam. Embedded consumers new up engines from their factories (`{Model}DatabaseEngine.Create(options)`); resources with DI wire this in their own hosting layer.
- **Engine-name uniqueness enforced at composition**, ordinal-ignore-case, matching `IDatabaseEngine.Name` semantics elsewhere.
- **Best-effort disposal with aggregation.** One failing engine must not leak the others' file handles; failures are collected and rethrown as `AggregateException`.

## Non-goals

- **No cross-engine transactions** — a transaction is scoped to one database in one engine.
- **No configuration binding here** — `cohesion.config` binding belongs to the consuming resource's hosting layer.
- **No lifecycle states beyond compose/dispose** — engines own their own `EngineState`.

## AOT posture

Pure composition; no reflection, no discovery. Consumers reference engine packages statically.

## Phase 29 root-contract migration

The embedded test engine now implements the root's `DatabaseName` operations and read-only `Servers`
observation. Embedded composition continues to own the engines explicitly supplied to
`EmbeddedDatabase`; this existing aggregate is separate from the hosting builder's
instance-borrowed registration contract.
