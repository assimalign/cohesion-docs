# Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.KeyValuePair.Storage design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.KeyValuePair.Storage`.

> **Status:** Partial.

## Design intent

The thinnest possible model-storage satellite: it types a storage file set as
`StorageModel.KeyValue` and exposes the kernel's protected record surface under entry-flavored names
(`InsertEntry`/`ReadEntry`/`UpdateEntry`/`DeleteEntry`). The key-value model deliberately brings
**no model-specific physical layout** — the generality bet of the second model is that the shared
substrate (slotted pages, per-owner record chains, WAL v2, recovery) serves an ordered key-value
store as-is, and this project is where that bet is visibly small.

## Why-this-not-that

- **A `Storage` subclass, not a wrapper.** `SqlStorage` set the family shape: the
  kernel's record operations are `protected`, and the model satellite is the
  sanctioned way to expose the subset a model composes. A wrapper would duplicate
  the surface; a public kernel record API would invite models to bypass their
  engines.
- **No entry codec here.** The record byte layout (16-byte version-stamp header +
  key/value tuple) is engine policy, tied to the engine's MVCC composition — it
  lives with the version store and executor in `Database.KeyValuePair`, exactly
  where `SqlRowCodec` lives in `Database.Sql`. This satellite stays byte-agnostic.
- **Owner-chain inserts are the primary insert path.** The engine keys every entry
  record by its key-space object id so the key space owns its pages (the #911
  per-object chain design). The shared-space overload exists for the catalog file
  set, whose records are few and unowned.

## Lifecycle

Instances are created/opened by the engine's storage strategy and disposed by the engine's database
instance. `Open(..., checkpointOnOpen: false)` is the reopen contract: the engine runs
`TransactionRecovery.Analyze` over the recovered journal before any truncation (classification reads
lifecycle records a checkpoint would destroy) and checkpoints through its coordinator once analysis
completes.

`WriteAheadJournal` publicly returns the existing `IStorageJournal` contract so a transaction
coordinator can share the storage's actual WAL. This is the same composition seam exposed by
Documents, Graph, and Blob storage and replaces the shipped-to-shipped friend grant. `Storage` retains
ownership of the journal; callers coordinate writes and checkpoints through the transaction
coordinator and do not dispose the journal separately.

## Non-goals

- **Model-specific page layouts (adjacency pages, blob streams)** — the key-value
  model needs none.
- **Public exposure of the kernel's full record surface** — only what the engine
  composes is exposed, including the journal contract required for transaction
  coordination. Paging, buffer management, and WAL implementation remain private.

## AOT posture

No reflection, no codegen — inherited span-based record operations only.
