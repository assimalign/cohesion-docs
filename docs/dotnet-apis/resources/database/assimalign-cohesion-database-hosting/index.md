`DatabaseApplication.CreateBuilder(args)` composes a complete `Database` host through dependency-free
model intent, one-shot `Build`, then ordinary engine access or the Hosting `Run` extensions. Engines are
operational at `Build`; optional nested servers begin listening at Start.

See the [source-backed usage examples](examples/index.md).

Model verbs are `AddSql`, `AddDocuments`, `AddGraph`, `AddKeyValue`, and `AddBlob`; they return
the application builder and ship with their model package. Servers and workers are registered with
deferred factories on the model engine builder. There is no application-level `AddServer` or `Use`
composition method. Direct model `Engine.Create(options)` remains available for standalone use.

The concrete hosting builder supplies `Configuration`, `Services`, build-aware
`AddEngine(name, factory)`, additional lifecycle services, health contributions and named
compiled-schema provisioning. Services start before servers; servers drain first. The root
interfaces expose no configuration or DI types. Runtime context includes all engines, their nested
servers, configuration and services.

Instance engines and services remain caller-owned. Factory products belong to the application;
engines own their nested servers/workers. `Application` disposal stops the host, disposes its owned
services and engines, then its provider, configuration and configuration file system. Legacy
options/direct construction remain borrowed-input paths. Each application supports one start
lifecycle.

Configuration loads optional base/environment JSON, `COHESION_CONFIG__` environment variables,
captured args and explicit providers. Services use the Cohesion interpreted resolver
(`EnableDynamicCode = false`) on both JIT and NativeAOT, with scope validation and explicit closed
factories/instances. See [DESIGN.md](design.md) for ordering, rollback, isolation and ownership
details.

The runtime references the area root and non-area infrastructure, never `Database` model packages.
Existing enabled-resource runner/admin/telemetry integration is preserved; this implementation adds
no ApplicationModel functionality.
