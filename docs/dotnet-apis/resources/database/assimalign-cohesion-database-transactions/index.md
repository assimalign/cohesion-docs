# Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.Transactions

The shared ACID substrate for every Cohesion database engine: MVCC visibility snapshots, isolation levels, hierarchical locking for write-write conflict control, and the transaction-log seam that binds commits to the write-ahead log.

> **Status:** Partial.

The shared ACID substrate for every Cohesion database engine: MVCC visibility snapshots, isolation
levels, hierarchical locking for write-write conflict control, and the transaction-log seam that
binds commits to the write-ahead log.

## Scope

- **`ITransactionManager`** — begin/commit/rollback lifecycle, sequence assignment, snapshot capture
- **`ITransactionContext`** — the engine-internal state of one in-flight transaction
- **`TransactionId` / `TransactionState`** — the transaction vocabulary the area root's `IDatabaseTransaction` contract consumes
- **`TransactionSnapshot` / `TransactionSequence`** — MVCC visibility (implemented, tested)
- **`ILockManager` / `LockMode` / `LockResource`** — hierarchical write locking with deadlock resolution
- **`ITransactionLog`** — the WAL binding (storage owns the physical journal)
- **`IVersionStore`** — the version-chain contract model storage layers implement
- **`TransactionAbortedException`** — an independent exception root (inherits `Exception`, not `DatabaseException`)

The coordinator's record ledger supports streamed model records: logical rollback, pruning, and
recovery scrub use bounded physical mutation batches, while lifecycle analysis streams the shared
journal instead of retaining page-image payloads.

## Dependencies

- **`Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.Storage` (child-to-child** — the journal/page substrate the implementations bind to)

This package is a **child root** of the `Database` area: the area root
(`Assimalign.Cohesion.Database`) references it — never the reverse — so the ACID substrate stays
independently consumable.

## Consumers

Every model engine (`Sql`, `Documents`, `Graph`, `Blob`, `KeyValuePair`) composes a transaction
manager; execution operators carry `ITransactionContext` into storage, index, and catalog
operations.
