# Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.Transactions design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.Transactions`.

> **Status:** Partial.

## Intent

One transaction substrate for five engines. ACID is the platform's defining requirement (area
`DESIGN.md` R1), so the machinery that provides it — MVCC snapshots, commit ordering, locking, WAL
binding — lives in a kernel project no model owns. Engines *use* the manager; sessions *expose* the
resulting `IDatabaseTransaction` from the contract root.

## Why MVCC (and not lock-based isolation)

Readers never block writers and writers never block readers — the OLTP profile all five models
share. Locking is retained only where MVCC cannot arbitrate: write-write conflicts, in
`ILockManager`, with intent modes so object-level operations (drop table, reindex) coexist with
entry-level writes.

## A child root — no area dependency

This package is a child root the area root aggregates (root → Transactions, never the reverse — the
2026-07-13 inversion; see the area DESIGN.md decision log). The transaction vocabulary lives here —
`TransactionId`, `TransactionState`, `TransactionSequence`, `IsolationLevel` — and the root's
`IDatabaseTransaction` contract consumes it through the root's child-root reference. The contracts
in this package speak only Transactions-owned types: the earlier doc-level nods to the root's
`IDatabaseTransaction` are *named* (`<c>`), not referenced (`<see cref>`), and the adaptation
between `ITransactionContext` and the public `IDatabaseTransaction` surface belongs to whoever owns
both vocabularies — the model engines' session/transaction implementations above the root (the same
place `IQueryTransactionScope` in `Execution` puts its engine adaptation, the area's standing
cycle-avoidance shape). `Storage` is the one reference (child-to-child): the journal/page substrate
the implementations bind to. The per-database composition below adds no project or package
dependency, including no dependency on Indexing.

## Identity vs. ordering: `TransactionId` vs. `TransactionSequence`

`TransactionId` is a GUID — a good *external* identity for sessions, diagnostics, and the wire
protocol, but unordered. Visibility decisions need a total order, so this project also has
`TransactionSequence`, a monotonically increasing `ulong` assigned at begin. The split mirrors
PostgreSQL's virtual-txid vs. xid distinction and keeps the public session surface free of MVCC
mechanics.

## Snapshot semantics

`TransactionSnapshot` captures `(owner, minimum, maximum, active-set)` and answers
`IsVisible(writer)`:

- **own writes →** — visible;
- **`writer >= maximum`** — (began after capture) → invisible;
- **`writer < minimum`** — (decided before the oldest in-flight) → visible;
- **otherwise → visible iff** — the writer was not in the active set.

Note the deliberate simplification: a version whose writer *aborted* below `minimum` must never be
consulted, so the version store — not the snapshot — is responsible for unlinking aborted versions
during rollback/recovery. That keeps the snapshot a pure value object with no commit-log lookup.
This duty is a contract member: `IVersionStore.PurgeWriterAsync(writer)`, called by the manager on
rollback/abort and by recovery for every sequence the journal cannot prove committed.

`ReadCommitted` refreshes the snapshot per statement; `Snapshot` (the default) and `Serializable`
fix it at begin. The refresh mechanism: the context's `Snapshot` property re-captures from the
manager's live active table on every access while the transaction is active — each statement reads
it once. `Serializable` layers conflict detection on top and is a post-MVP feature — the enum member
exists so the surface doesn't churn.

## The manager implementation

`TransactionManager.Create(log, lockManager, versionStore, sequenceAllocator?)` returns the default
manager. Lifecycle ordering encodes the write-ahead rule: commit appends the commit record and
awaits durability *while the transaction is still in the active table* — no snapshot can observe it
as committed before its record is on stable storage; only then does it leave the table and release
its locks as a set. A commit whose record cannot be made durable aborts (versions purged, locks
released, state `Faulted`) and surfaces `TransactionAbortedException`. `OldestActive` is the
pruning bound: `min(active)` or `lastAssigned + 1` when idle. A manager rejects a context begun on a
different manager instance (identity check, not just type check).

**The sequence allocator (why an external hook and not a seed).** An engine that pairs manager
transactions with storage brackets passes the storage's own allocator
(`IStorage.ReserveTransactionSequence`) so both layers share **one sequence namespace**. The
per-database composition uses separately sequenced physical statement brackets; only the logical
transaction's own commit proves its writer stamp committed. Internally sequenced storage brackets
can never collide with manager assignments. The alternative — seeding the manager once at open and
letting two counters run — was rejected because any storage-side allocation after the seed (an
auto-commit record bracket) reintroduces collisions. The allocator is invoked *inside* the manager's
begin lock, atomically with active-table insertion, which is what keeps snapshot capture race-free:
another transaction's snapshot either sees the new sequence in the active set or was taken before it
existed. Sequences the allocator hands to non-manager consumers never stamp row versions, so the
snapshot maximum (`lastSeen + 1`) remains a correct visibility bound even when it trails the storage
counter.

## The lock manager implementation

A lock table keyed by `LockResource` with the classic five-mode compatibility matrix (S/U/X/IS/IX),
same-owner upgrades (an owner's own grants never block it), FIFO waiter wake-up on `ReleaseAll`,
and wait-for-graph deadlock detection: a request that would close a cycle aborts *itself* with
`TransactionDeadlockException` — the newest-waiter-as-victim policy, chosen because it needs no cost
model and the victim is retryable by construction. Waits are `TaskCompletionSource` -based and honor
cancellation.

## The WAL binding

`Storage` owns the physical journal (`Database.Storage`); `ITransactionLog` is the *logical* seam:
begin/commit/abort records with the write-ahead rule (commit acknowledges only after durability).
`Group` commit is an implementation freedom, not a contract change. This split lets the transaction
manager be tested against an in-memory log (`TransactionLog.CreateInMemory()`) while the real one
rides the storage journal (`TransactionLog.CreateJournalBound(IStorageJournal)` — commit appends and
calls `EnsureDurable`, so concurrent commits naturally share fsyncs).
`TransactionRecovery.Analyze(journal)` is the restart-side counterpart: a sequence committed iff its
commit record is durable; everything else is aborted and must be purged from version stores.

## Error model

`TransactionAbortedException : Exception` for engine-initiated aborts (an independent exception root
— this package is a child root and must not depend on the area contracts; a model engine that
surfaces an abort through the area's session contract wraps it in a `DatabaseException` at the model
boundary, the same rule the engines apply to `StorageException`);
`TransactionDeadlockException : TransactionAbortedException` for deadlock victims (retryable by
construction). Caller-initiated rollback is not an error and throws nothing.

## The engine binding (first adopter: the SQL engine)

The area's recorded *isolation split-brain* — a complete MVCC manager no engine used — closed with
the SQL engine's session binding (area DESIGN.md §3.8; work items under #862). The integration kept
this package exactly as shaped:

- **The **model engine session**** — binds the root's `IDatabaseTransaction` to an
  `ITransactionContext` from a per-database `ITransactionManager` — the binding
  lives above both vocabularies (the SQL and KeyValuePair session/transaction adapters),
  per this document's "child root" section; nothing here learned about the area
  contracts. Kernel aborts cross the model boundary wrapped in the root's
  `DatabaseTransactionAbortedException`.
- **The root's isolation-level seam** — plumbs this package's `IsolationLevel` enum
  end-to-end: the manager's per-level semantics (`ReadCommitted` per-access
  refresh, `Snapshot` fixed at begin) are engine behavior now. `Serializable`
  is rejected by the SQL engine until serialization-conflict detection exists —
  the contract forbids running weaker than requested.
- **The engine's transaction log** — is journal-bound to its storage's WAL; the
  sequence allocator (above) unifies the sequence namespace, and per-statement
  storage brackets are the physical WAL brackets beneath the manager (their
  commit records ride the same journal; the manager's commit record owns
  durability through journal ordering). `IStorageTransactionSource` (in
  `Database.Indexing`) is the pairing seam the engine adapts from the shared coordinator —
  resolving a context's current statement bracket. Recovery drives the
  version store's aborted-writer purge from `TransactionRecovery.Analyze` at
  every database open — and `Analyze` reads the active-sequence list out of
  checkpoint records, so classification survives journal truncation beneath
  in-flight transactions.
- **The shared `RecordSpaceVersionStore` implements** — `IVersionStore` over the engine's
  record access adapter (the in-memory store remains for tests and
  embedded working state): row versions live in data pages as stamped records,
  and the store is the *ledger* of each writer's effects, which is what makes
  `PurgeWriterAsync` a physical logical-undo and `PruneAsync` a physical
  space reclamation. `ILockManager` arbitrates row-grain write conflicts
  (exclusive locks on row identity, intent locks at table grain for DDL — the
  B+Tree uniqueness precedent generalized), and deadlock victims cross the
  model boundary as the root's `DatabaseTransactionDeadlockException`.
- **The engine's version-purge worker** — drives the reclamation duties on its own
  timer (#910): `PurgeWriterAsync` retries for aborted writers whose inline
  undo failed, and `PruneAsync` below the safe snapshot bound — the minimum
  snapshot floor across open transactions, not `OldestActive` alone, which
  can trail a live snapshot's view (see the `Sql` DESIGN.md for the recorded
  bound decision). With that, all four §3.8 steps are implemented.

## Shared per-database composition (#918)

`TransactionCoordinator(storage, journal, records)` owns one manager, lock manager, record-space
version store, gated transaction log, and statement apply semaphore per database. Pass the journal
belonging to that same storage. The caller owns the storage/journal lifetime and disposes the
coordinator before closing them. SQL and KeyValuePair use this composition directly; there is no
engine-specific copy of its ledger, recovery, prune-bound, or journal-gate mechanics.

The seam follows the executable differences between the original implementations:

- **`ITransactionRecordSpace`** — supplies read/update/delete and physical location
  packing/unpacking. The storage's existing unit iterator scans the stamped
  records. SQL retains its object-id/column tuple and row APIs; KeyValuePair
  retains its key/value tuple and entry APIs. Their current location encoding is
  `(pageId << 16) | (ushort)slotIndex`, but the ledger treats it as an opaque identity.
- **`IRecordVersionIndex`** — supplies stamp-checked erase and clear-deleter operations
  over encoded key bytes. Indexing's `RecordVersionIndex` adapts `IIndex` to this
  new contract. Indexing already references Transactions; the reverse reference
  would form a cycle. The ledger copies keys at registration, keeps index undo
  in the same physical bracket as record undo, and retries the same entries on
  failure. No member was added to any existing interface.
- **The engine adapts `TryGetStorageTransaction`** — to the existing Indexing pairing
  seam, retaining its `DatabaseException` when no statement bracket exists.
  Transactions never references the area root or its exceptions.

`RecordSpaceVersionStore` is a ledger over actual records, not a second payload store. Logical
rollback deletes created versions and clears tombstones only when their current stamps match the
recorded writer. A failed physical statement can leave stale ledger entries; missing/reverted slots
remain harmless through the original `StorageException` /`ArgumentOutOfRangeException` handling and
stamp rechecks. Committed tombstones enter the prunable set. Pruning requires `deleter < safeBound`
and rechecks the current deleter before deleting. `Index` undo stays in recorded order, including its
original accounting semantics.

### Record stamp prefix: the 16-byte contract

Every record supplied by the adapter starts with this prefix. `RecordVersionStamp` owns its encoding
and the two engines' codecs delegate their stamp operations to it.

| Offset | Size | Encoding | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 8 bytes | unsigned 64-bit, little-endian | Writer `TransactionSequence.Value` |
| 8 | 8 bytes | unsigned 64-bit, little-endian | Deleter `TransactionSequence.Value` |
| 16 | remaining bytes | engine-defined | Payload, left untouched by stamp helpers |

Writer zero denotes bootstrap/migrated data visible to every snapshot; deleter zero means no
deletion. A nonzero deleter is a tombstone, not physical removal. Visibility is exactly
`snapshot.IsVisible(writer) && (deleter == None || !snapshot.IsVisible(deleter))`. Setting or
clearing a deleter produces a copy of the same length and changes only bytes 8–15, so stamp changes
cannot relocate a record. Short records (less than 16 bytes) are ignored by store visibility, undo,
and recovery scans as before; the low-level helpers require a complete prefix. Payload
interpretation and legacy format upgrades remain engine policy. B+Tree entries retain their own
physical layout and existing stamp implementation.

### Recovery and checkpoint interlock

The ordering is deliberately the same as in both original engines:

1. `Open` storage with its automatic open-time checkpoint deferred, allowing
   physical WAL recovery without discarding logical transaction classification.
2. Attach the engine's persisted indexes.
3. `AnalyzeAndScrub` analyzes the recovered journal once, removes records created
   by unproven writers, clears their tombstones, and seeds surviving committed
   tombstones for pruning. It then reserves a storage sequence as the recovered
   floor, above every pre-restart stamp.
4. The engine scrubs its attached indexes with that same plan in a durable
   storage bracket.
5. `CompleteRecovery` checkpoints last, before sessions can begin. Truncating
   earlier would erase the lifecycle records needed to classify index entries.

During normal operation, begin/commit/abort appends and changes to the log's active-sequence set
share one monitor with checkpoint capture and truncation. A begin cannot land between capturing the
checkpoint's active list and truncating the journal. `Commit` appends and removes its active sequence
under that monitor, then calls `EnsureDurable` outside it; a checkpoint that truncates first has
already durably flushed the outcome. The manager keeps the transaction active until durability
completes. This ordering has not been replaced with an independent manager-table snapshot.

Statement apply, logical undo, and pruning share one semaphore. Engine conflict locks are acquired
before statement apply, keeping genuine lock waits outside that semaphore and visible to deadlock
detection. Statement brackets commit non-durably unless the caller selects the existing durable
DDL/bootstrap path; the logical commit makes earlier statement records durable by journal ordering.
`Open`-time scrub remains ungated because no sessions exist yet.

Logical undo, pruning, and recovery scrub apply at most 64 record/index mutations per physical
bracket. A blob transaction can contain many thousands of chunks; retaining every touched page's
before-image in one undo bracket would otherwise buffer the entire object. Each batch commits before
the next begins. Stamp checks make retries idempotent even when earlier batches committed before a
later batch failed: the full ledger is requeued, already-undone versions are skipped, and the
remaining work completes. Recovery scrub keeps at most 64 replacement payloads in memory. The ledger
and prune candidates still scale with record count.

Transaction recovery consumes `StorageJournal.ReadSequential` for the shared journal implementation
and falls back to the existing `IStorageJournal.ReadAll` contract for custom journals. This changes
no public interface. Only sequence classification survives iteration; physical page-image payloads
are not retained.

The safe prune bound starts at `max(manager.OldestActive, recoveredSequenceFloor)` and is reduced to
every open context's `Snapshot.Minimum`. A snapshot captured while an older writer was active can
retain a floor below the current oldest active transaction, so using only the manager's bound would
reclaim visible data. The purge pass retries failed abort undo before pruning, exactly as before.

## Non-goals

- **No distributed transactions / two-phase commit** — single-node ACID first.
- **No lock escalation policy in the contract** — an implementation concern.
- **No savepoints in the MVP surface** — add to `ITransactionContext` when a model needs them.

## AOT posture

Static composition, contracts and value objects; `FrozenSet<ulong>` for the active set. The shared
composition and engine adapters use ordinary calls and BCL synchronization. No reflection, dynamic
code generation, or `Microsoft.Extensions.*`.
