# Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.Graph design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.Graph`.

> **Status:** Partial.

## String comparison and collation (#1025)

Graph remains ordinal-only. String property predicates use case-sensitive .NET ordinal (UTF-16
code-unit) comparison; property index keys encode the same order. Labels, edge types, property keys,
and query variable bindings retain ordinal, case-sensitive identity. Administrative database lookup
remains ordinal-ignore-case. SQL database defaults and `COLLATE` overrides do not apply to GQL or
graph storage. Configurable graph collation is deferred; no case or accent folding is applied to
stored labels or property values.

## Composition and frozen contracts

The fifth database engine follows Documents' parser/planner/executor composition and Blob's
engine-owned lifecycle. `GraphDatabaseEngine` is the public factory and engine implementation;
database, session, transaction, planner and executor implementations are internal. Its dependencies
are the area root, Connections and the Graph.Language, Graph.Catalog and `Graph.Storage` packages.
`Storage` uses shared `Storage`, Transactions and Indexing rather than another pager, journal or lock
manager.

| Package | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `Database.Graph` | Engine, sessions, typed operations, planning, execution, catalog protocol server and path message family |
| `Database.Graph.Language` | ISO GQL subset, AST and syntax/capability diagnostics |
| `Database.Graph.Catalog` | Snapshot-visible labels, types, property keys, index metadata and ownership |
| `Database.Graph.Storage` | Record encoding, kernel adapter, adjacency and property B+Trees |

The engine references the area root, transport abstraction and its model packages; the protocol and
security contracts arrive through the area's root composition. These are dependency edges:

    Engine --> Connections["Connections"]

    Engine --> Catalog["Graph.Catalog"]
    Engine --> Storage["Graph.Storage"]
```

No existing public interface changed. `IGraphDatabase` accepts an explicit `IDatabaseSession` for
each data operation. Every entry point checks the concrete session's database identity; sharing an
engine or database name is insufficient. `GraphSchema.Open(database, session)` returns the new
`IGraphSchema` interface, also bound to that exact database and session. Its operations join the
session transaction. Administrative database lifecycle remains on `IDatabaseEngine`; no GQL AST can
select a server, another database, or another graph.

## Physical records and adjacency

Each logical database owns `graph.dat`, `graph.log` and `graph.bak`. All records start with the
shared 16-byte little-endian writer/deleter transaction stamp. The graph payload's byte 16 is the
kind, byte 17 is format version 1, and bytes 18–25 are a nonzero unsigned 64-bit identity. Graph
identities are reserved from the shared storage sequence allocator, so rollback does not recycle an
identity. `Database`-local IDs must always be paired with the correct session.

| Page owner / kind | Payload after the stamp |
| --- | --- |
| Owner 0, catalog | Catalog-specific version, discriminant and encoded definition; see Graph.Catalog's format |
| Owner 2, kind 1 | Common graph header, label count and strings, then scalar property map |
| Owner 2, kind 2 | Common graph header, source ID, target ID, type string, scalar property map |
| Owner 2, kind 3 | Common graph header, indexed label and property key |
| Owner 1, kind 4 | Zero stamps, kind/version, tree object ID, signed 64-bit root page; 34 bytes total |

Counts and fixed integers are little-endian. Strings use BinaryWriter's UTF-8 encoding with a 7-bit
encoded byte-length prefix. Property maps are ordered by ordinal key and preserve scalar type tags.
The exact tag table and index tuple encodings live in
[Graph.Storage DESIGN.md](../assimalign-cohesion-database-graph-storage/design.md) , which is the
format reference for another reader. Properties support null, Boolean, string, integral, decimal and
finite floating point values. Records fit one shared slotted page; oversized records are rejected
before publication. Large graph properties/chunking are deferred.

The adjacency B+Tree contains one entry per incident endpoint, keyed by `(node ID, relationship ID)`
and pointing to the relationship's packed physical record location `(page ID << 16) | slot`. A
self-loop has one entry. The relationship record carries both directed endpoints and its type;
direction/type filtering occurs after the node-prefix seek. Composite keys avoid duplicate-key
boundary ambiguity after B+Tree splits. A node identity map reconstructed from records at open
provides constant-time identity lookup followed by a stamped page read.

The diagram shows the references stored by the adjacency and property trees; relationship records
carry endpoint identities referring to node records.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Adj["Adjacency B+Tree: node ID, relationship ID"] --> Rel["Stamped relationship record"]
    Rel --> Src["Source node record"]
    Rel --> Dst["Target node record"]
    Prop["Property B+Tree: scalar, node ID"] --> Src
    Reg["Persisted tree registrations"] --> Adj
    Reg --> Prop
```

An incident lookup costs `O(log E + degree)` index work plus one record read per incident edge;
deterministic result ordering adds `O(degree log degree)` CPU work. Direct traversal costs the sum
of these lookups for expanded nodes and uses `O(Vvisited)` visited state. A label scan examines node
records and sorts its matches. A property equality anchor instead seeks its shared B+Tree in
`O(log N + candidates)` after locating index metadata, then sorts its matches. `Index` numeric keys
normalize integral, decimal and finite floating point values through double conversion. Full scalar
comparisons filter index candidates, preserving exact integral/decimal comparisons despite key
collisions. Comparisons involving a floating point operand use double precision, including subnormal
values. All node creation/deletion paths maintain property indexes. Graph has no property-update
verb.

## Transactions, atomicity and recovery

One `TransactionCoordinator` per database owns MVCC, logical undo, journal durability, lock
management and physical statement brackets. A conservative database writer lock serializes writers
through their logical commit or rollback; readers use snapshots. Metadata and affected graph records
are checked against the latest committed view after lock acquisition, so a stale writer cannot
create an orphan endpoint or bypass a newer schema constraint.

Node creation and label/key metadata participate in the same logical transaction. Relationship
creation writes its record and both adjacency entries in one physical bracket. Deleting a node with
`DETACH DELETE` tombstones its incident relationships, adjacency and property entries with the node
atomically. Plain GQL `DELETE` refuses a still-connected node. `DELETE r,a` first deletes explicitly
selected relationships, then checks the nodes. The frozen typed `DeleteNodeAsync` contract
explicitly cascades and is implemented that way. Any mutation failure rolls back the owning logical
transaction, including an explicit session transaction, as in Documents.

Snapshot and ReadCommitted isolation are supported. ReadCommitted captures and pins a statement
snapshot, so metadata and each hop of a traversal share a visibility horizon. Serializable is
rejected rather than silently weakened. Explicit transactions use the existing session API; GQL
transaction-control syntax is outside the profile. Results materialize before the statement
transaction is released, so result iteration cannot race record reclamation.

`Open` defers the storage checkpoint, performs physical WAL recovery, then invokes coordinator record
scrub, opens catalog/store indexes, purges unproven index writers using the same recovery plan, and
checkpoints last. The process fixture exits after committed graph/index creation and after
uncommitted detach/insertion page write-back, without disposal. Restart must recover the committed
path and index, remove partial nodes/types/edges, and undo partial tombstones; it then reopens a
second time to verify the recovery checkpoint.

## Planning, execution and bounds

`GqlQueryParser` builds `GqlQueryStatement`; `GraphPlanner` resolves labels, relationship types,
variable kinds and access paths; `GraphPlanExecutor` applies that plan. The planner considers
literal inline properties and equality predicates joined by `AND` for every node position in a
pattern. It can anchor at the middle or end, expanding right and then left with appropriately
reversed directions. Bound variables from earlier comma-separated patterns take precedence over a
fresh scan. Every selected candidate still passes labels, property predicates and bindings.

GQL patterns are finite chains of at most 64 relationships. Each matched path is a trail: an edge
identity is used at most once within that path; a node may recur. Separate comma-separated paths
have separate edge sets and share variable bindings. This makes a three-edge cycle a valid three-hop
result but forbids reusing its first edge on a fourth hop. At most 100,000 intermediate path matches
materialize per pattern, and a statement examines at most 1,000,000 node/edge candidates, including
dead ends; either overflow fails with `COHDBG004`, never silent truncation. Cancellation is
observed during expansion and materialization. Repeated node/relationship variables enforce identity
equality, and conflicting variable kinds fail before execution.

`TraverseAsync` implements the frozen `GraphTraversal` contract separately: breadth-first traversal,
an explicit nonnegative maximum depth, a visited-node set seeded with the start, and no repeated
nodes. It excludes the start even when a cycle or self-loop reaches it. Incident edges are ordered
by identity, making the breadth-first result deterministic. Its result contains visited nodes; GQL's
projected `a,r,b` values expose the actual frozen `GraphNode` /`GraphRelationship` objects through
`QueryRow.GetValue`. Property projections return scalars. This does not add a path member to the
frozen traversal contract.

The
[supported-clause matrix](../assimalign-cohesion-database-graph-language/design.md#supported-clause-matrix)
is the single executable-language inventory: MATCH, WHERE, RETURN, INSERT, CREATE (compatibility
extension), DELETE, DETACH DELETE and SHOW (catalog extension). Parameters, functions,
variable-length paths, aggregations, ordering, graph selection and language DDL are not advertised.
Label/type/index management is the session-bound C# schema API. The ISO decision and conformance
corpus are documented alongside the parser; this is a bounded ISO subset, not a full conformance
claim.

## Catalog introspection (C2)

`GraphSchema.Open(database, session)` already supplies in-process discovery of labels, relationship
types, property keys and indexes. C2 preserves that interface and makes the same catalog reachable
through textual requests on the existing `IDatabaseSession.ExecuteAsync` query boundary. Dedicated
`SHOW` statements are Cohesion GQL extensions, not ISO conformance claims. A catalog definition is
not a graph node: exposing it through `MATCH` would invent graph identities and relationships and
would reserve labels in the user graph. `SHOW` instead returns a typed result set with no fabricated
graph elements or persisted system data.

`GraphDatabaseServer.Create(engine, options)` exposes these statements to the existing generic
model-owned catalog exchange over the shared `Database.Client` connection infrastructure. The
composition root supplies an `IConnectionListener` through `GraphDatabaseServerOptions.Listener` and
owns the engine lifecycle; the server owns the listener and its accepted sessions. Startup
authentication binds each connection to one database. Typed scalar result columns and rows use the
Graph-owned catalog codecs, including GUID identities and nullable ownership values. The catalog
server deliberately supports only `SHOW` statements: other graph queries return `ExecutionFailure`
with `The graph wire server supports catalog SHOW statements only.` The path codecs below provide
graph element serialization for a subsequent query server/client; those clients remain outside this
increment. No existing interface gained a transport member.

Each statement has a fixed ordered column contract. All name columns are strings, identity columns
are GUIDs, and `IS_REQUIRED` and `IS_UNIQUE` are Booleans.

| Statement | Columns in result order |
| --- | --- |
| `SHOW LABELS` | `DATABASE_NAME`, `LABEL_ID`, `LABEL_NAME` |
| `SHOW RELATIONSHIP TYPES` | `DATABASE_NAME`, `RELATIONSHIP_TYPE_ID`, `RELATIONSHIP_TYPE_NAME` |
| `SHOW PROPERTY KEYS` | `DATABASE_NAME`, `DEFINITION_TYPE`, `DEFINITION_ID`, `DEFINITION_NAME`, `PROPERTY_KEY`, `DATA_TYPE`, `IS_REQUIRED` |
| `SHOW INDEXES` | `DATABASE_NAME`, `LABEL_ID`, `LABEL_NAME`, `INDEX_NAME`, `PROPERTY_KEY`, `IS_UNIQUE` |
| `SHOW OBJECT OWNERSHIP` | `DATABASE_NAME`, `DEFINITION_TYPE`, `DEFINITION_ID`, `DEFINITION_NAME`, `OBJECT_TYPE`, `OBJECT_NAME`, `OWNER`, `OWNING_SCHEMA` |

`DEFINITION_TYPE` distinguishes `LABEL` from `RELATIONSHIP TYPE`, including when both have the same
name. `DATA_TYPE` is the declared shared `DatabaseType` name, or null for an unconstrained key;
observed property values do not invent a declared type. Current node-property indexes are nonunique,
so `IS_UNIQUE` is false. `Storage` pages and physical index registrations stay internal. Definition
names and their child names retain the catalog's ordinal ordering; label definitions precede
relationship-type definitions. Definitions remain discoverable when the last graph element is gone.

Ownership follows SQL's `COHESION_SCHEMA.OBJECT_OWNERSHIP` vocabulary: `OBJECT_TYPE`, `OBJECT_NAME`
, `OWNER` (`Adhoc` or `Schema`) and nullable `OWNING_SCHEMA`. The owning schema is the
compiled/schema authority, never a graph namespace. Label and relationship-type rows report their
persisted owner. Property and index metadata has no independent ownership field: its rows report the
parent definition's authority because catalog mutation enforcement checks that parent. `OBJECT_TYPE`
is `LABEL`, `RELATIONSHIP TYPE`, `PROPERTY KEY` or `INDEX`; the definition identity disambiguates
children.

The executor reads all definitions and children using the operation's existing pinned MVCC snapshot.
Snapshot transactions retain their original visibility; ReadCommitted and auto-commit statements
observe catalog changes at statement start. Own uncommitted definitions are visible in the same
transaction, other sessions cannot see them, and rollback leaves no virtual rows behind. Dropping a
definition removes its property/index/ownership rows from fresh snapshots. Results are computed at
execution time and never materialized into the graph's persistent record space.

`SHOW` always targets the session's logical database. There is no database qualifier, server
listing, graph selection, filtering, projection, or mutation composition in this bounded extension.
An attempt to append a mutation clause returns `GQL0007: Graph catalog introspection is read-only.`
before any writer lock or data mutation; hand-built ASTs have the same protection. Unsupported read
composition returns the ordinary syntax/binding diagnostic. Since no synthetic graph objects are
created, ordinary graph writes cannot address or change these result rows.

## Metadata and diagnostics

Labels, relationship types and discovered property keys persist even when the last data object is
deleted. Discovery sees the session snapshot. `New` data introduces ad-hoc definitions. A supplied
property definition can require a value and its database scalar type; adding a constraint validates
existing objects first. Unsigned integer values map to the next wider signed database type (`byte`
to Int16, `ushort` to Int32, `uint` to Int64, `ulong` to `Decimal`); persisted CLR types remain
unchanged. Unsupported property types are refused. Dropping an in-use label/type is refused. Schema
ownership is enforced on drop and every alter/index/property-metadata path with
`DatabaseObjectLockedException`, naming the object, owning schema and operation. An initial
directly marked definition is supported to exercise that enforcement path; compiled provisioning is
not included.

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `COHDBL001` | Unsupported language capability, reported on the parsed statement |
| `GQL0001`–`GQL0006` | Parser syntax/literal/bound errors; see language design |
| `GQL0007` | Attempt to mutate catalog introspection results |
| `COHDBG001` | Invalid pattern, variable binding or traversal specification |
| `COHDBG002` | Unknown label or relationship type |
| `COHDBG003` | Schema/data mismatch, restricted deletion or invalid graph mutation |
| `COHDBG004` | Path materialization or candidate-expansion limit exceeded |
| `COHDBG005` | Session/database binding mismatch |
| `COHDBG006` | `Storage` failure translated at the engine boundary |

Planner/data errors use stable code prefixes on `DatabaseException`. Kernel aborts cross the engine
boundary as `DatabaseTransactionAbortedException`; deadlocks retain their specialized subtype.
Ownership uses the shared dedicated exception rather than an invented graph ownership code.

## Lifecycle and delivery

Engine construction starts WAL-flush, page-writeback, checkpoint and version-purge workers, exposed
through `Workers`. State is Running until a worker fails (Faulted) or disposal begins (Disposed).
Disposal is idempotent: stop and join workers, abort outstanding transactions, durably flush and
close each database. Logical commits are synchronous through the coordinator even when physical
grouped durability is configured. The flush worker still services the storage group-commit seam.

Names are single path components, directory lookup is case insensitive, and enumeration includes
persisted databases not yet open in memory. `Root`-builder `AddGraph` captures a deferred engine
factory without Hosting dependencies. The family is included in all solution, framework, CI and
release-inventory surfaces. General graph wire queries, model security policies, replication,
Hosting/ApplicationModel changes and compiled-schema provisioning remain out of scope. The catalog
server uses the shared authenticator rather than adding graph-specific authentication contracts. No
reflection or runtime code generation is used.

## Graph wire family

`GraphProtocol.Family` fixes the graph vocabulary for an accepted connection. Shared
`ProtocolChannel` handles framing and validates every type against the bound family; Graph owns all
request/result payloads. The endpoint selects Graph before startup. No model discriminator is added
to startup, and a connection or client pool cannot change families. Other endpoints may use the same
model-scoped bytes for other meanings; shared codes 1–4 and 10–13 retain their meanings and 14–63
remain reserved. Bytes 5–9 retain Graph's deployed catalog exchange. The path extension uses 64–66.
This follows the shared lexer/parser and per-model grammar precedent.

Version **1.0** is retained: the deployed catalog, SQL and `Key`-Value exchanges are byte-for-byte
unchanged. Unknown major versions receive shared `UnsupportedVersion`. Compatible negotiation
chooses the smaller server/requested minor. The wire envelope is unsigned 32-bit big-endian payload
length, one type byte, then the payload. The length excludes the five-byte header and cannot exceed
16,777,216. Integers below are big-endian. A string is a nonnegative signed `int32` UTF-8 byte
length followed by those bytes. There is no padding.

| Byte | Direction | Payload |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5 (`Execute`) | Client → server | GQL string; `int32` parameter count; repeated parameter-name string, `int32` encoded-value byte length, value bytes |
| 6 (`ResultHeader`) | Server → client | `int32` column count; repeated column-name string and one `DatabaseType` byte |
| 7 (`ResultRow`) | Server → client | Concatenated self-describing scalar tuple components, exactly one per declared column |
| 8 (`ResultComplete`) | Server → client | `int64` affected count; -1 for a catalog result set |
| 9 (`Transaction`) | Client → server | Reserved legacy identifier; current catalog server rejects it as out of order |
| 64 (`ExecutePaths`) | Client → server | The same GQL/parameter payload as byte 5, requesting path-shaped results |
| 65 (`Path`) | Server → client | Ordered node and relationship sequences in the format below |
| 66 (`PathsComplete`) | Server → client | Exactly eight bytes: nonnegative `int64` count of Path frames in this exchange |

Catalog parameters and tuples retain `DatabaseValueCodec` encoding; the precise scalar tags, numeric
transforms and variable-length escaping are specified in the unchanged SQL scalar wire encoding
(`cohesion/resources/Database/Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.Sql/docs/WIRE-PROTOCOL.md`). The catalog
response is `Header`, zero or more Row frames, Complete; command responses may have only Complete. A
shared Error ends the current exchange without Complete. Existing SHOW statements and their ordered
column contracts above remain supported by `GraphDatabaseServer`. Its new channel is bound to
`GraphProtocol.Family` once, before the handshake. Path messages are the public wire surface for
subsequent graph query server/client work; sending ExecutePaths to the current catalog server
produces shared `ProtocolViolation` and closes that session. The path tests use a test-owned
responder executing the real engine and exchanging frames over `Connections.InMemory`.

### Path payload

A Path payload consists of the following fields, with no trailing bytes:

1. `int32 nodeCount`, followed by `nodeCount` node records in traversal order.
2. `int32 relationshipCount`, followed by `relationshipCount` relationship records in traversal order.

The other family layouts remain prose-only. `Execute` (5) and `ExecutePaths` (64) share one payload:
bytes 0–3 hold the signed 32-bit big-endian statement length `S`, the statement starts at byte 4,
and bytes `4 + S` –`7 + S` hold the signed 32-bit big-endian parameter count. Each parameter then
starts at some byte `Q` with a signed 32-bit big-endian name length `N` at `Q`, `N` name bytes at
`Q + 4`, a signed 32-bit big-endian encoded-value length `V` at `Q + 4 + N`, and `V` tuple-codec
bytes at `Q + 8 + N`. `ResultHeader` (6) starts with its signed 32-bit big-endian column count at
bytes 0–3; each repeated column has the same four-byte name length and name bytes followed by one
`DatabaseType` byte. `ResultRow` (7) is self-delimiting tuple components from byte 0 through the
payload end. The `ResultComplete` (8) encoder emits one signed 64-bit big-endian affected count at
bytes 0–7. `Transaction` (9) is reserved and has no accepted graph payload. `PathsComplete` (66) is
exactly a nonnegative signed 64-bit big-endian path count at bytes 0–7 with no trailing bytes.

A valid Path always contains a first node, so its payload has an exact 16-byte fixed prefix. At
payload-local bytes 0–3 (bits 0–31) is the positive signed 32-bit node count in big-endian order;
bytes 4–11 (bits 32–95) are the first node's nonzero unsigned 64-bit identity in big-endian order;
and bytes 12–15 (bits 96–127) are that node's nonnegative signed 32-bit label count in big-endian
order. Its length-prefixed labels and property map follow, then any remaining node records, the
relationship count, and the repeated relationship records described below. The packet view below
shows this exact fixed Path prefix; all variable and repeated tails remain in prose.

```mermaid
packet-beta
0-31: "Node count (positive i32, big-endian)"
32-95: "First node ID (nonzero u64, big-endian)"
96-127: "First node label count (nonnegative i32, big-endian)"
```

A node record contains `uint64 id`, `int32 labelCount`, that many label strings, then a property
map. A relationship record contains `uint64 id`, `uint64 fromNodeId`, `uint64 toNodeId`,
relationship-type string, then a property map. Identities are nonzero, database-local unsigned
integers; their entire 64-bit range is preserved. Counts are nonnegative and bounded by the
remaining payload before allocation. Each path contains at least one node and exactly one fewer
relationships than nodes. Relationship `i` connects node `i` and node `i+1`; either direction is
permitted. `From`/To always retain the graph's stored edge direction, including during reverse
traversal. A one-node path has zero relationships; repeated nodes, cycles and self-loops remain
representable.

A property map is `int32 propertyCount` followed by property-name string and tagged value for each
property. Names are ordinal and unique within the map; map entry order is not significant. Graph's
scalar tags preserve the existing engine's numeric runtime types, including unsigned types absent
from the shared catalog tuple codec. Their precise payloads are:

| `Tag` | Value | Bytes after tag |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | null | None |
| 1 | false | None |
| 2 | true | None |
| 3 | string | Length-prefixed UTF-8 string |
| 4 | byte | One unsigned byte |
| 5 | sbyte | One two's-complement byte |
| 6 | Int16 | Two-byte two's-complement integer |
| 7 | UInt16 | Two-byte unsigned integer |
| 8 | Int32 | Four-byte two's-complement integer |
| 9 | UInt32 | Four-byte unsigned integer |
| 10 | Int64 | Eight-byte two's-complement integer |
| 11 | UInt64 | Eight-byte unsigned integer |
| 12 | Single | Four-byte IEEE-754 binary32 bit pattern |
| 13 | Double | Eight-byte IEEE-754 binary64 bit pattern |
| 14 | `Decimal` | Four 32-bit words: low, middle, high 96-bit unsigned coefficient limbs, then flags |

`For` `Decimal`, flags bit 31 is the sign, bits 16–23 hold the scale 0–28, and all other bits must be
zero. Its value is `(-1)^sign × coefficient / 10^scale`. Each word is big-endian; limb order is
low, middle, high. Single and Double must be finite. Unknown tags, duplicate property names,
malformed lengths/counts, zero IDs, disconnected relationships and extra path bytes are protocol
violations. Node labels and relationship types remain model strings; no fake table schema is
introduced.

After Ready, the path client sends ExecutePaths and consumes zero or more Path messages followed by
one PathsComplete, or a shared Error with no completion. Requests are serialized. The completion
count must match received paths; zero matches requires count zero. Each path fits one frame; this
family does not impose Blob streaming on graph results. Codecs perform static, explicit encoding and
decoding with no reflection or runtime serializer metadata.

The sequence shows the graph-owned path exchange within the shared connection lifecycle:

    end

```

## Phase 29: deferred hosting composition

The owner-approved `Database` hosting composition
(`cohesion/docs/programs/DATABASE_HOSTING_DESIGN.md`) is implemented as
`AddGraph((context, engine) => ...)` on `IDatabaseApplicationBuilder`. This replaces
`AddGraphDatabase`. The model callback runs during application `Build` and receives an
`IGraphDatabaseEngineBuilder`. It configures the complete option set, including
`FileSystemPath? RootPath`, durability, storage strategy, identity and worker intervals; it neither
binds configuration nor accesses a service container. Retained builder options and factories reject
mutation after the first engine `Build` attempt.

`AddWorker` and `AddServer` take factories whose engine argument exists before the factory runs. The
engine schedules custom workers through the common `IDatabaseEngineWorker.Run` contract; this is the
concrete generic consumer that earns `IDatabaseEngineBuilder`. There are no additional strongly
typed factory overloads: a model-specific factory can cast its argument, while ordinary workers
remain portable across models. The engine owns successful factory products and cleans them up on
subsequent construction failure. Nested servers must front that exact engine. The application
snapshots each engine's Servers for start/stop; disposing the engine disposes its servers and custom
workers.

`GraphDatabaseEngine.Create(options)` remains the standalone entry point. `Application` factory
registrations are application-owned; instance registrations remain caller-owned, including their
nested components. All four named database operations now take `DatabaseName`, with the existing
implicit string conversion preserving ordinary literal call sites. Empty/default names are rejected.

The explicit requirement for StorageStrategy supersedes the draft's statement that this model lacks
a storage injection parameter. `IGraphStorageStrategy` provides create/open/drop, existence and
discovery using the existing `GraphStorage` product. It overrides RootPath without allocating
default files; returned storage is engine-owned and the strategy itself is borrowed. Durability is
supplied explicitly, and opening must defer checkpointing until engine recovery. Default file/memory
selection remains unchanged.

`GraphDatabaseEngine.CreateBuilder()` exposes the model builder for the concrete hosting builder's
`AddEngine(name, build => ...)` overload. The consumer assigns resolved configuration/service
values, registers nested server/worker factories, and returns `Build()`; the model package still
never sees DI. There is no generic production orchestration over `IDatabaseEngineBuilder`; the base
contract supports model-agnostic worker composition, demonstrated by tests exercising the public
factory through that base interface.
