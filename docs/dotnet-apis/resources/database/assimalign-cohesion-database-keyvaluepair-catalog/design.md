# Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.KeyValuePair.Catalog design

This page describes the boundaries and implementation shape of `Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.KeyValuePair.Catalog`.

> **Status:** Partial.

## Design intent

The smallest catalog in the model family, on purpose. A key-value database's only durable metadata
is what re-attaches it on open: the primary index's physical registration and the entry-space format
version. Everything else a relational catalog carries (schemas, tables, columns, constraint
descriptions) has no key-value counterpart — the parent issue's design note ("do not hide catalog
and security semantics behind a raw dictionary metaphor") is honored by making the catalog
**explicit and small**, not by inventing relational ceremony for a model that has none.

## Why-this-not-that

- **A dedicated catalog file set, not records mixed into the data file.** The SQL
  family precedent (`<name>` + `<name>.catalog`) holds: catalog writes are
  self-committing storage transactions with no MVCC layer above them, and mixing
  self-committing records into a data file whose journal carries logical
  transaction lifecycles would entangle recovery classification with metadata
  writes. Symmetry also keeps the engine's storage strategy identical to SQL's.
- **The `DefaultSqlCatalog` persistence pattern, reduced.** One tuple-codec record
  per concern (kind 1 = registrations, kind 2 = format version), rewritten in
  place when it fits and relocated when it grows. The registration codec matches
  `DefaultSqlCatalog`'s byte-for-byte so the family stays mutually legible; a
  shared registration-codec helper is deliberately not extracted yet (two
  instances, both trivial — the extraction threshold is the third model).
- **Format version named `EntrySpaceFormatVersion`, not `RecordSpaceFormatVersion`.**
  The key-value model was born on format 1 (MVCC-stamped entries in the key
  space's page chain); the name scopes the marker to the model's own vocabulary.
  There is no upgrade machinery because there is no older format — the engine
  writes the marker at creation and rejects unknown newer versions at open.

## Query-time introspection captures (C2)

The engine's `KEYSPACES` command describes the single implicit key space from this catalog.
`KeyValueCatalog.CaptureSnapshot(IKeyValueCatalog)` returns an `IKeyValueCatalogSnapshot` containing
the entry-format marker and index registrations copied together under the existing metadata lock.
The engine alone projects those values into client rows; the catalog stores no virtual objects or
materialized discovery records. An existing capture is unaffected by later metadata publications.
The capture is a `public static` method on `KeyValueCatalog` that downcasts to the internal
implementation, not a member of `IKeyValueCatalog`: it replaces the shipped-to-shipped friend grant
without making every future catalog implementation owe the capability. This deliberately mirrors
`SqlCatalog.CaptureSnapshot`; the two sibling catalogs are the same shape and are kept that way.
`IKeyValueCatalogSnapshot` is public because it is that method's return type; its implementation
remains internal, the capture owns no storage and requires no disposal, and registrations are
exposed through a read-only collection, matching their existing catalog vocabulary rather than
adding command-result types here.

The capture contains one database's metadata because this catalog is opened on that database's
dedicated file set. The engine omits physical index page ids and exposes the command as read-only.
Its two mutation verbs reject the `KEYSPACES` target with `DatabaseParseException` and the stable
message `The KEYSPACES catalog surface is read-only.` Catalog mutation APIs continue to serve
internal persistence; they are not command operations. The model has no schema ownership or named
key-space records, so introspection invents neither.

## Error model

`KeyValueCatalogException : DatabaseException` — a malformed persisted record or invalid metadata
write. Catalog failures are database failures to callers.

## Non-goals

- **`Key`-space registries (multiple named key spaces per database)** — deferred; the
  engine currently owns one implicit key space (object id 1).
- **TTL/expiration metadata** — deferred with the model feature.
- **`Constraint` descriptions** — key uniqueness is enforced physically by the unique
  primary index; there is nothing to describe.

## AOT posture

Tuple-codec encode/decode only; no reflection, no serialization frameworks.
