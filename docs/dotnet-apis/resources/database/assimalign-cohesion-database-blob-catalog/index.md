`Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.Blob.Catalog` persists the containers and blob metadata of one logical
database. Its public factory returns `IBlobCatalog`; the implementation is internal. It depends on
the `Database` root for the ownership vocabulary, `Blob.Storage` for record access, and the shared
`Storage` and Transactions kernels for durability and MVCC.

`Open` `BlobCatalog` after the database coordinator has scrubbed recovered records. Container records
carry a stable identity, case-sensitive name, `DatabaseObjectOwner`, and optional owning schema.
Blob records carry the container identity, name, length, media type, entity tag,
creation/modification times, content checksum, and chunk-chain head.

Supply an `ITransactionContext` to every mutation and a `TransactionSnapshot` to every read. The
caller acquires the model locks and owns commit or rollback. The catalog never commits the supplied
transaction. Its metadata shares the content storage and journal so publication of a new head and
its chunks has one logical commit decision.

Blob listing supports an ordinal prefix and reads metadata records only. Ownership enforcement
belongs to the Blob engine; the catalog can persist a directly marked schema-owned container without
introducing compiled-schema provisioning.

See [DESIGN.md](design.md) for the directory, format, and recovery rules.
