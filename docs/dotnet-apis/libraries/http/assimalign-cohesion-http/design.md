# Assimalign.Cohesion.Http design

Design decisions and ownership boundaries for `Assimalign.Cohesion.Http`.

[Overview](index.md) · [Examples](examples/index.md)

## Design and boundaries

Headers and trailers are distinct ordered field sections using compatible collection primitives.
Optional concerns attach through feature and interceptor seams rather than widening the protocol
root. The core remains independent of hosting and resource platforms.

## Dependency boundary

The declared build inputs are `Assimalign.Cohesion.Core`. The [overview](index.md#dependencies)
distinguishes project references, package references, shared source, and analyzer inputs.
