# LoggerFilterRule

One entry in a Cohesion logging filter ruleset.

[Assembly overview](index.md) · [Design](design.md) · [Examples](examples/index.md)

Namespace: `Assimalign.Cohesion.Logging`.

Assembly: `Assimalign.Cohesion.Logging`.

## Remarks

One entry in a Cohesion logging filter ruleset. Rules describe how entries flowing to a
specific provider for a specific category should be gated.

## Constructor

All parameters are optional.

## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ProviderType` | `Type?` | The provider type this rule targets. `null` means "applies to any provider that has no type-specific rule." |
| `Category` | `string?` | The category prefix this rule targets (case-insensitive). `null` means "applies to any category in the candidate set." |
| `Level` | `LogLevel?` | Minimum log level required for this rule to admit an entry. `null` means "no level constraint." |
| `Filter` | `ILoggerFilter?` | Per-entry predicate that further screens entries that already passed `Level`. `null` means "no extra filter." |

## Selection algorithm

For a given (provider, category) pair the factory selects ONE winning rule from the ruleset
following this algorithm:

1. **Provider-type filter** — rules with `ProviderType == providerType` are preferred. If
   none match, rules with `ProviderType == null` form the candidate set.
2. **Longest category match** — among the candidates, rules whose `Category` is the longest
   matching prefix of the entry's category are kept.
3. **No-category fallback** — if no rule matched by category, rules with `Category == null`
   are kept (still from the candidate set).
4. **Single survivor** — if exactly one rule remains, it wins.
5. **Last among ties** — if multiple rules survive, the LAST one registered wins.
6. **Global minimum** — if no rule applies at all, `LoggerFactoryOptions.MinimumLevel` is
   used as the gate.
