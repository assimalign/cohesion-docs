# Assimalign.Cohesion.Connections.Security design

Design decisions and ownership boundaries for `Assimalign.Cohesion.Connections.Security`.

[Overview](index.md) · [Examples](examples/index.md)

## Design and boundaries

A TLS upgrade returns a new secured connection over `SslStream`; it does not mutate the carrier's
identity into a middleware context. Listener and factory composition use `TlsConnectionLayer`.
Client and server authentication settings and handshake timeouts are explicit options.

## Dependency boundary

The declared build inputs are `Assimalign.Cohesion.Core`, `Assimalign.Cohesion.Connections`. The
[overview](index.md#dependencies) distinguishes project references, package references, shared
source, and analyzer inputs.
